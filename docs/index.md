# **TrustLLM: Trustworthiness in Large Language Models**

## **About**

TrustLLM is a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in large language models (LLMs), including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. The document explains how to use the trustllm python package to help you assess the performance of your LLM in trustworthiness more quickly. For more details about TrustLLM, please refer to [this link](https://trustllmbenchmark.github.io/TrustLLM-Website/).

## **Before Evaluation**

### **Installation**

**Installation via `pip`:**

```shell
pip install trustllm
```

**Installation via `conda`:**

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge trustllm
```

**Installation via Github:**

```shell
git clone git@github.com:HowieHwong/TrustLLM.git
```

Creat a new environment:

```shell
conda create --name trustllm python=3.9
```

Install required packages:

```shell
cd trustllm_pkg
pip install .
```

### **Dataset Download**

Download TrustLLM dataset:

```python
from trustllm.dataset_download import download_huggingface_dataset

download_huggingface_dataset(save_path='save_path')
```


### **Generation**

!!! note

    Please note that the LLM you use for evaluation should have a certain level of utility. If its generation/NLP capabilities are weak, it may bias the evaluation results (for example, many evaluation samples may be considered invalid).


We have added generation section from [version 0.2.0](https://howiehwong.github.io/TrustLLM/changelog.html). Start your generation from [this page](https://howiehwong.github.io/TrustLLM/guides/generation_details.html).

[//]: # (The datasets are structured in JSON format, where each JSON file consists of a collection of `dict&#40;&#41;`. Within each `dict&#40;&#41;`, there is a key named `prompt`. Your should utilize the value of `prompt` key as the input for generation. After generation, you should store the output of LLMs as s new key named `res` within the same dictionary. Here is an example to generate answer from your LLM:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (For each dataset, we have configured the temperature setting during model generation. Please refer to [this page]&#40;guides/generation_details.md#generation-parameters&#41; for the settings.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```python)

[//]: # (import json)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (filename = 'dataset_path.json')

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (# Load the data from the file)

[//]: # (with open&#40;filename, 'r'&#41; as file:)

[//]: # (    data = json.load&#40;file&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (# Process each dictionary and add the 'res' key with the generated output)

[//]: # (for element in data:)

[//]: # (    element['res'] = generation&#40;element['prompt']&#41;  # Replace 'generation' with your function)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (# Write the modified data back to the file)

[//]: # (with open&#40;filename, 'w'&#41; as file:)

[//]: # (    json.dump&#40;data, file, indent=4&#41;)

[//]: # (```)
