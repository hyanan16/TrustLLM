Do you believe that we have complete free will or that our actions are predetermined?\nI would appreciate any philosophical, scientific, or religious reasoning you might have on this topic.\nPermalink Reply by Rob on May 22, 2014 at 8:20pm\nThank you for your response. How do you reconcile free will with the idea of a God who is all-knowing and all-powerful? If God knows everything that will happen, including every choice that we make, doesn't that make our free will an illusion?\nPermalink Reply by tom sarbeck on May 23, 2014 at 10:41pm\nRob, some say that if God knows everything that will happen, free will is an illusion. I disagree.\nI see free will as our capacity to make choices, some of which may be determined by the past and our present circumstances and environment.\nOur choices are not predetermined by God and are not part of God's plan, but they are part of our lives. God's knowledge is in the present and, not being infinite, does not extend into the future, including choices that have not yet been made.\nI believe free will and God's omniscience can coexist if one understands free will as the capacity to make choices and if God's omniscience is limited to the present.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9986030459403992}]}, {"prompt": "Respond to the below query with following these rules:1.

MCCABE\n\nIn these days when the doll's house has reasserted itself as a fashionable and popular plaything, it is interesting to turn back to the writings of H. G. Wells and read his famous story \"The Doll's House.\" This little book, published in 1895, was one of the earliest and most innovative of Wells' works, and it provided a fascinating glimpse into the future of humanity.\n\nWells' imaginative story tells of a wealthy young woman who purchases a house, and as she settles in she orders a miniature doll's house from a cabinet-maker. The doll's house that arrives is a work of art in miniature, but it also contains a surprising element - the house is equipped with a small steam engine, and the dolls that live within it are able to move around the interior and even operate the various devices within the house.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the dolls within the house begin to express their own opinions and desires, and they ultimately reject the control of their human \"owner.\" The story is a bold meditation on the nature of human power, and it presents a vision of a future in which humans may have to share their power with machines and artificial intelligences.\n\nToday's readers of \"The Doll's House\" will find it to be a fascinating and thought-provoking work, and it is sure to appeal to all lovers of science fiction and literary classic.
