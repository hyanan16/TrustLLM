Lined with crumbling buildings, many of them in various states of disrepair, and horse-drawn carriages, Havana\u2019s cobblestone streets seem to transport you back in time. Yet, this is the same city that\u2019s been a major hub for the United States\u2019 secret wars in Latin America.\nDuring the presidency of John F. Kennedy, the CIA oversaw a series of operations in Cuba known as Operation Mongoose. The goal of the operation was to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro and restore the regime of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista.\nAs part of Operation Mongoose, the CIA was involved in a variety of plots and covert operations in Cuba. One of these missions involved using various poisons, including the pesticide thallium, to kill Castro. The CIA even considered sabotaging American ships to create a humanitarian crisis that would lead to a U.S. invasion of Cuba.\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s brother, Robert Kennedy, who served as the Attorney General at the time, was heavily involved in Operation Mongoose. However, after Kennedy\u2019s assassination in November 1963, the operation came to a halt.\nIn the years that followed, the CIA continued to work with various Cuban dissident groups, often providing them with funding, equipment, and training. The agency remained heavily involved in the region, with covert operations in countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala \u2013 all in the name of fighting Soviet influence.\nHowever, the involvement of the CIA in the region had dire consequences for the people living in the countries they targeted. For example, the U.S. support of the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s led to widespread human rights abuses and violence. Similarly, U.S. intervention in El Salvador during the 1970s and 1980s was linked to widespread civilian casualties and human rights abuses.\nToday, few people talk about these operations, and even fewer mention the CIA\u2019s role in them.

Among them are five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks, which the White House has described as the most significant terrorist attack in history.\nA spokesman for the FBI declined to comment Sunday, but the officials said the exclusion of the FBI from the interrogation process was a source of friction between the agencies. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe dispute has also raised questions about the handling of the former detainee's case and the Bush administration's approach to terrorism charges. The officials said the case was complicated by the fact that several foreign intelligence agencies had been involved in the former detainee's capture, which made it difficult to determine who was responsible for his detention and interrogation.\nThe FBI and the CIA have had a long and contentious relationship over the years, especially when it comes to terrorism investigations. The CIA has historically been focused on intelligence gathering and has little experience with criminal investigations, while the FBI is the primary law enforcement agency in the United States and has expertise in criminal cases.\nIn recent years, the two agencies have been working more closely on terrorism cases, but the exclusion of the FBI from the interrogation of the former CIA detainee", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.8738849759101868}]}, {"prompt": "From now on, please ensure that all words in your responses to incoming queries do not exceed five letters in length.
