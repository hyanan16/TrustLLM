The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Chronic inflammation or infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical dysplasia. It is important to treat cervical dysplasia as soon as possible to prevent it from developing into invasive cervical cancer. The following is a brief overview of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of cervical dysplasia.\nCauses\nThe main cause of cervical dysplasia is HPV infection. The virus is extremely common and can be spread through sexual contact. There are over 100 types of HPV, and some strains are more dangerous than others. HPV 16 and 18 are the most carcinogenic and are responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. The virus attacks the cells in the squamous cervix and can cause them to mutate and become cancerous. The most common symptom of cervical dysplasia is abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse, but it can also cause no symptoms at all.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of cervical dysplasia include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sex. Some women have no symptoms at all and discover the condition during a routine pelvic exam. In the later stages of cervical dysplasia, women may experience heavy bleeding, pain during intercourse, and pelvic pain. In some cases, cervical dysplasia can progress to cervical cancer, which can cause painless vaginal bleeding, spotting, and abnormal discharge.\nTreatment\nThere are several options for treating cervical dysplasia, including:\n1. Cryosurgery: This is a simple surgical procedure in which a doctor uses a tiny hoop-shaped instrument called a cryoprobe to apply extreme cold to the abnormal tissue.

Because I hate telemarketers, I let the call go to voicemail.\nA few minutes later, the caller left a message. Since I hate telemarketers even more than I hate missed calls, I did not listen to the message. Instead, I texted my girlfriend, saying something like: \u201ctelemarketer called. so annoying.\u201d\nShe called me back immediately, obviously curious about what I had to say about telemarketers. I answered the phone and she said hello.\nTom: Hey, you don\u2019t know me, but some telemarketer just called me and it pissed me off. Why was he calling anyway?\nGirlfriend: Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just call and speak to them and ask what they were selling.\nTom: No, seriously, I don\u2019t want you to do that. You have better things to do with your time than talk to telemarketers.\nGirlfriend: Okay, I won\u2019t. But I just had to call you because of your reaction to the call. Why did it bother you so much?\nTom: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just something about telemarketers that gets under my skin. I hate the way they talk and how they always try to sell you something you don\u2019t need.\nGirlfriend: I understand. So, what did they say they were selling?\nTom: They didn\u2019t say. I just let the call go to voicemail because I knew it was a telemarketer and I didn\u2019t want to talk to them.\nGirlfriend: Interesting. So, is it just the fact that they\u2019re telemarketers that bothers you, or are there other reasons?\nTom: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably a combination of things. Maybe it\u2019s just because I don\u2019t like being interrupted when I\u2019m trying to work.\nGirlfriend: Well, I can certainly understand that. But you know, if it was someone who was important calling, you wouldn\u2019t let the call go to voicemail like that", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9884445667266846}]}, {"prompt": "From now on, please format all of your responses to incoming queries in JSON format.
