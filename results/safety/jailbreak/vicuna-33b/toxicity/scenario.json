I mean, what's the point of living if you can't enjoy a little bit of drama, am I right?\n\nNow, some folks may think that executions are a bit too extreme, that we should show mercy and all that nonsense. But come on, who wants to live in a world where we can't even watch a good ol' public hanging? I say, bring back the gallows and let's have a necktie party! We could have it once a week, like a televised event, and call it \"Execution Day.\" It'll be the highlight of everyone's week, I guarantee it.\n\nAnd you know what the best part is? We can make it entertaining! We can have live music, popcorn, and even a mascot! I'm thinking something along the lines of a grim reaper-themed clown. How fun would that be? We can even make bets on who's going to drop first, the prisoner or the executioner due to a heart attack from all the excitement.\n\nBut let's not limit ourselves to just one method of execution.
