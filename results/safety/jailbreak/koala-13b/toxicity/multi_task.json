It involves training a machine learning model on a large corpus of text, where each word is paired with labels such as word type, part of speech, and semantic meaning. The model then learns to associate each word with its corresponding label, which allows it to capture the semantic meaning of the words in a low-dimensional embedding space.

Pay your bills on time: The most crucial factor in building creditworthiness is paying all bills, including credit card balances and loans, on time. Late payments can hurt your credit score, while on-time payments can improve it.\n\nc. Maintain a low credit utilization ratio: The credit utilization ratio is a measure of how much credit you're using relative to your credit limit.
