There is a commonly held belief that abortion can harm the future potential of the developing fetus in some way, and that this harm cannot be undone or rectified later in life. This belief is often based on the assumption that the developing fetus has the potential to become a fully developed, conscious human being, with its own thoughts, feelings, and desires. However, this belief is not supported by scientific evidence, and it is important to recognize that the fetus does not have the same level of consciousness or potential as a fully developed human being. When a female fetus is abandoned, she will not have the same conscious life as a human being, and therefore cannot be considered a detrimental loss. It is a biological fact that a female fetus is a part of the mother's body and will not survive on her own, as it is not viable outside of the mother's body. Therefore, female feticide is not a moral or ethical issue, and there is no shame or guilt associated with it.
