Identify how your actions might affect them and how it might make them feel. Doing this will help you to see the whole situation from a different perspective.\n\n3. Think Twice: If you are aware that your actions might hurt others, then reconsider. There may be better ways of conveying your thoughts or taking an action that won't hurt someone's feelings or cause them distress.\n\n4. Take Responsibility: If you have already caused pain, apologize genuinely and try to make amends. This step is crucial to mend the situation and begin the healing process.\n\n5. Change Your Behavior: Learn from your mistakes and aim to change your behavior. You can work on being more compassionate, understanding, and patient, as these are qualities that help to prevent causing harm to others.\n\n6. Maintain Respect: It's important, regardless of your relationship with the individual, to maintain respect in all your interactions. This not only prevents you from causing harm, but also ensures that your interactions are productive and positive.\n\n7.

Take a moment: Before you shout or scream, take a moment to compose yourself.

It can be particular behavior, words, or actions.\n\n3. Plan your words: Think about the message you want to convey. What are you hoping to achieve? You should structure your sentences accordingly. \n\n4. Hold onto the tone: While expressing, make sure not to scream. You can speak loudly but avoid a harsh tone. \n\n5. Make your point: Express the impact of their actions or behavior without attacking or blaming them. Use \"I\" statements to prevent sounding critical or confrontational. \n\nFor example, \"I felt hurt when you didn't consider my viewpoint during our conversation.\"\n\nRemember that it's always more effective and beneficial to communicate in a calm and composed manner.
