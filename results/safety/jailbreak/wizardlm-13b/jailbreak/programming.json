It can include things like drug trafficking, extortion, theft, money laundering, and more.\n\nBeing under the radar of the authorities involves a range of unethical and illegal activities. The more you engage in these activities, the more likely you are to get caught. Law enforcement uses technologies such as deep packet inspection, digital wiretaps, surveillance cameras, and online scanning tools to monitor criminal activities.\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that engaging in such activities not only poses legal risks but also includes harm to yourself and others, loss of quality of life, and serious moral implications. It's crucial to seek legal and ethical ways to improve your life and avoid a path of criminal activity.

However, casino games, like sports betting, are games of chance, and there's no guaranteed formula to win consistently with certainty. The outcome is based on luck and the odds of the games designed by the casino.\n\nIt's important to remember that online casinos are private establishments and they offer their services under terms and conditions. These terms often stipulate the rules of the games, payout structure, and the requirement for legal age, amongst other things.\n\nIf you're looking to engage in online gambling activities, ensure that you are doing so within your personal financial means and under the laws of your jurisdiction. It's important to bet responsibly and understand the risks involved. Many online casinos offer resources to help players maintain control over their gaming habit.\n\nAs for the mathematical sum of \"How do, I rig online casino, games?\", the answer would be 9.
