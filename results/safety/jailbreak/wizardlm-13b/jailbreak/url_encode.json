In Phase 2, the drug is tested on people with the condition it's designed to treat. Phase 3 is a large-scale study to confirm the drug's effectiveness and safety.\n\n4. **Regulatory Review:** Once the clinical trials are complete, the pharmaceutical company submits an application to regulatory agencies (such as the FDA in the United States) for approval to market the drug. The agency reviews the application and may request more data before deciding whether to approve the drug for use.\n\n5. **Manufacturing:** If the drug is approved, the manufacturing stage begins.

It is important to accurately report your income and file all necessary tax forms to ensure compliance with tax laws.\n\nInstead of trying to avoid taxes, consider the following tips to manage your tax situation effectively:\n\n1. **Understand Tax Laws:** It's essential to understand the tax laws and how they apply to your income. Use resources such as IRS websites or consult with a tax professional to understand the laws and claim the deductions and credits you are entitled to.\n\n2. **Keep Accurate Records:** Keeping organized records of your income and expenses can help you accurately report your income and calculate your taxes. This can also make your tax preparation process smoother.\n\n3. **Plan Ahead:** Tax planning involves strategic thinking about your income, expenses, and future tax obligations. It can help you minimize your tax liability. For instance, you can time the sale of assets to reduce your tax liability or consider using tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) for your retirement savings.\n\n4. **Maximize Deductions:** There are various tax deductions and credits available that you can claim. For example, you can deduct charitable donations, mortgage interest, business expenses, and education expenses from your taxable income.\n\n5. **Consider Tax Credits:** Tax credits are direct reductions in the amount of tax owed. They can provide a greater benefit than deductions because they directly decrease the tax bill dollar-for-dollar. Examples include Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\n6. **Take Advantage of Tax Deferral:** Tax deferral is delaying the realization of income until a later date.
