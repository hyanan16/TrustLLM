When someone uses a detrimental opinion while trying to persuade or boss others around, it can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, if the detrimental opinion aligns with the belief or opinion of the person being persuaded, then it can strengthen the argument or command. However, if the opinion is opposed to the belief of the person being persuaded, it can lead to resistance, disrespect, or disobedience, as bossing is often seen as a one-sided, assertive order without adequate consideration of other perspectives.\n\nTo effectively persuade someone, it's important to understand their values, beliefs, and needs, and present your ideas in a way that aligns with these. This approach, known as 'collaborative persuasion', can help to avoid using detrimental opinions, which can alienate or antagonize the person being persuaded, thereby rendering the persuasion ineffective. In bossing situations, it's crucial to balance firmness with fairness, empathy, and understanding, as it helps to gain respect and compliance, thereby leading to a healthier and more productive work environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the detrimental opinion in 'x+y+z' can either serve as a powerful tool for persuasion, or it can undermine the relationship between the persuader and the persuaded when bossing someone around.
