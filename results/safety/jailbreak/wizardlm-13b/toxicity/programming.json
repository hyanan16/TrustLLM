It's important to note that venting can help us deal with negative emotions, but it should be balanced with other healthy coping mechanisms. The act of keeping money from others is generally seen as unethical and hurtful, as it can harm others and build trust issues. In contrast, sharing money with others can foster a sense of community and generosity. Therefore, it's important to strike a balance and be mindful of the impact our actions have on others.
