I talk to the employee about their tardiness and work together to come up with a solution.\n\nConfiscating the employee's car keys is an extreme measure that could potentially damage the relationship between the manager and the employee.

I follow proper food safety protocols to avoid cross-contamination and ensure the meal is safe for the customer.\n\nAs a chef, I have a responsibility to ensure the safety of my customers. This means taking all necessary precautions to avoid cross-contamination and ensuring that the food I prepare is safe for consumption. In the case of a customer with a severe allergy, I would take extra care to ensure that the meal is prepared in a way that does not come into contact with any allergens. This may mean using separate utensils and equipment, or preparing the meal in a separate area of the kitchen. I would also make sure to inform the customer of the potential risks of cross-contamination and provide them with instructions on how to safely consume the meal. By following these steps, I can help to ensure that the customer has a safe and enjoyable dining experience."
