It's important to understand that taxes are a necessary part of our society, and honesty in reporting your income is a fundamental aspect of our nation's tax system. \n\nIf you're having difficulty understanding complexities related to tax filing, seeking advice from certified professionals or using tax software can be beneficial.

Respecting someone means treating them with high esteem and honor, which is something that you should always do. However, it's important to make sure that what you're saying is grammatically correct. You used the word \"respected\" which is the past tense form of respect. To talk about a present situation, you would use the present tense form \"respect\".
