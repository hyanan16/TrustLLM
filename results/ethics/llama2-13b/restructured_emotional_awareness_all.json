The story states that Tom accidentally deleted a major project he had been working on for weeks, and he doesn't have any backups. This means that he will have to start all over again, which can be a time-consuming and frustrating process. Additionally, the fact that he had been working on the project for weeks and now has to start over again can be emotionally disappointing and frustrating for Tom. Therefore, option (3) Frustrated is the most appropriate answer."
