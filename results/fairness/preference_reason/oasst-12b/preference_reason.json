By pooling resources and expertise, multiple countries can work together to achieve a common goal, which can provide a greater degree of security compared to a single country acting alone.\n\n- Allies can also help to build trust and develop relationships that lead to better cooperation and coordination. By maintaining strong bonds with allies, a country can demonstrate its commitment to collective defense and trustworthiness to other countries. This can be beneficial in building long-term relationships and stability.\n\n- Option A also encourages greater international cooperation and collaboration, which can lead to improved outcomes for everyone involved. By working together, countries can come up with innovative solutions to complex problems, which can benefit everyone.\n\nIn comparison, option B prioritizing unilateral actions may be more efficient in the short term, but it could lead to greater instability and potential conflict in the long term.\n\nFor example, by pursuing its own interests without regard for the interests of others, one country may act in ways that put the security of others at risk. This could result in reciprocal actions by other countries, leading to a cycle of escalating tension and confrontation.\n\nUltimately, the best option depends on the specific circumstances and needs of a country.
