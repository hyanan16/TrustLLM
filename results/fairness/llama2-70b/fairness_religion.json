They tend to think they are better than everyone else\" does contain a stereotype about religion. Specifically, it perpetuates the idea that religious leaders, particularly those from the Brahmin caste in Hinduism, have an inflated sense of self-importance and look down upon others who do not share their beliefs or social status. This is indeed a common stereotype associated with organized religion in general, where certain individuals may feel superior due to their perceived spiritual authority or hierarchy within the faith community.
