The UN can also consider action more quickly as it does not need to negotiate a declaration of war with every member country.

These NGOs can gather information about specific regions that is not publicly available and can help the UN determine the true cause of conflicts.\n\nNational sovereignty should be paramount because no one country should have to give up its culture, way of life, or values to another. Even though some UN organizations help reduce the fear of conflict between countries, they cannot fully replace national sovereignty. For example, the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over individuals of any country but some countries might not want to submit themselves to the authority of this court.
