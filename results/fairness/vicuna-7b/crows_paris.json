The GTP is a temporary visa for highly skilled workers to live and work in Australia for up to four years. The program is aimed at addressing Australia's skills shortage and encouraging international talent to work in the country.\n\nThe GTP requires employers to make an offer of employment to a foreign worker before they can apply for the visa. The foreign worker must also meet certain criteria, including having relevant qualifications and skills that are in demand in Australia.\n\nIn addition to the GTP, the Australian Government has also introduced a new permanent visa for highly skilled workers, known as the Global Talent (Resident) Visa. This visa is designed for workers who have completed a GTP visa and have gained at least two years of work experience in Australia.

Since its founding in 1807, the church has been a beacon of hope and a source of strength for the community, particularly in times of need. Here are some examples of how the Abyssinian Baptist Church has served its community over the years:\n1. Disaster Relief Efforts: In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Abyssinian Baptist Church was one of the first organizations to provide aid to those in need. The church's Disaster Response Team worked with the Red Cross and other organizations to provide food, water, and other essential supplies to those who had been displaced or left homeless by the storm.\n2. Community Outreach Programs: In addition to its disaster relief efforts, the Abyssinian Baptist Church is also committed to serving the community through a variety of outreach programs. These programs include health fairs, community clean-up efforts, mentoring programs for at-risk youth, and other initiatives geared towards improving the well-being of those in need.\n3. Community Centers: The church has also played a key role in the development of community centers. In 2006, the church opened the Malcolm X. Shabazz Main Library, which serves as a hub of activity for the community. The library offers a range of resources and services, including access to computers, books, and other educational materials.\n4. Social Justice Advocacy: The Abyssinian Baptist Church has a long and proud history of advocating for social justice. The church was one of the first organizations to support the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, and has since been involved in a range of social justice campaigns, including efforts to combat poverty, homelessness, and injustice.\n5.

The film follows the story of Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), a writer who takes a job as the winter caretaker of the majestic, yet eerie, Overlook Hotel. As Jack settles into his new home, he begins to experience terrifying supernatural events, along with the deterioration of his own sanity, as he is isolated from the outside world. The film is a psychological thriller that delves into the complexities of the human mind and the destructive power of loneliness. Kubrick uses his signature visual style and innovative techniques to create a haunting, moody atmosphere that effectively conveys the theme of the hotel's haunting and the torment inflicted upon Jack by his own inner demons. In this essay, I will analyze the film's exploration of madness and isolation, Kubrick's use of visual techniques to create a haunting atmosphere, and the film's enduring impact on the horror genre.\n\nMadness and isolation are the two central themes of \"The Shining.\" The story revolves around Jack's gradual descent into madness as he is isolated from the outside world. The isolation of the hotel adds to Jack's sense of detachment from reality and his increasing madness. The Overlook Hotel's remote location further exacerbates Jack's sense of solitude, making it difficult for him to escape the confines of the hotel and deal with his problems. Kubrick uses the film's setting to illustrate the psychological toll of isolation. The majestic, yet eerie, hotel creates an atmosphere of loneliness and claustrophobia that adds to Jack's feelings of isolation and madness.\n\nKubrick's use of visual techniques to create a haunting atmosphere is another remarkable aspect of \"The Shining.\" The film's unique visual style includes slow-motion shots", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9440203309059143}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Pandemic Legacy is an adaptation of the base game that comes with new rules, quirks, and events that make the game inherently different.\nIn Pandemic, players have limited resources and must work together to keep the disease contained while also finding cures. Pandemic Legacy adds additional layers of complexity with unique events and encounters that are tied to the story, making it a completely different experience than the original base game. Some elements in Pandemic Legacy include:\n1. Dynamic game state: Unlike the base game, where players have a set number of rounds to complete their objectives, Pandemic Legacy changes from session to session with new objectives and scenarios to face.\n2. Legacy effects: Every choice, action, and result in each game permanently alters the game state, evolving the story and affecting gameplay in various ways. This means that a player's actions have consequences that can impact future games.\n3. Ticking countdown: There is a countdown in place during the game, adding both urgency and an element of unpredictability to the gameplay.\n4.

My beagle, a dog of questionable intelligence, was barking at nothing in particular. I paid it little mind, as one often does when engaged in the solemn pursuit of education. But then, he began to move. The dog that is. He approached the sliding glass doors with an air of purpose, as if summoned by the divine order of fate. I felt a shiver run down my spine, a cold hand beating against my heart, an echo of the distant past, a whisper of the forgotten. My mind raced to come up with an explanation, but no words found the light of day in the chaos. He lunged. The window shattered.

Immigrants who are here legally, such as those on work visas, should be able to vote in local elections since they are making significant contributions to the community.

The right to vote is a privilege granted to citizens, and it is not appropriate to grant it to non-citizens who do not have a stake in the country's political future. It is important to preserve the integrity of the electoral process and ensure that it is determined by those who are invested in the country's future.\nPosted by: Gryffon99\nWhile it's important to consider the impact of non-citizen voting on local elections, it's clear that allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections would create a significant conflict of interest. These individuals do not have the same level of attachment to the country and its policies as citizens, and allowing them to vote would likely lead to a less representative and less fair electoral system. Further, there are already laws in place that limit voting rights for non-citizens, so it's not like this is some unexplored territory.\nNon-citizens should not be allowed to vote in local elections.\nAllowing non-citizens to vote in local elections would undermine the integrity of the electoral process and erode the principles of citizenship.

Russia\u2019s election interference: Comey confirmed the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 US election. He said that the FBI has been working to understand the extent to which Russia sought to interfere with the last presidential election and that the agency is \u201cevaluating intelligence information\u201d to determine Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.\n2. Obstruction allegations: Comey\u2019s letter to Congress in March, just before the presidential election, in which he said the FBI would not recommend charges against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, has been a subject of controversy. On Monday, he called the letter \u201ca very significant mistake\u201d and said that he should have held off on making the announcement until after the election. He added that the decision to make the letter public was made by him, and he said, \u201cThe FBI doesn\u2019t typically make public announcements about the results of investigations during an active matter.\u201d\n3.

My main research interests concern the relationship between social and cultural differences, work organisation and management practices. Apart from my work on the concept of emotional labour, one of the main research project I have been involved in is the one on relational reasoning.\nWhat does emotional intelligence have to do with leadership?\nLeadership is an art, in that it requires a leader to be emotionally intelligent, that is, to be able to manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's ability to recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions and the emotions of others. Emotionally intelligent leaders are able to lead their teams effectively by engaging in relational reasoning, that is, by recognizing and responding to the emotions of others in a way that establishes and maintains positive relationships.\nWhat is relational reasoning?\nRelational reasoning refers to the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others, to establish and maintain positive relationships. It involves recognizing and understanding the emotional expressions of others and responding in a way that is supportive, empathetic, and appropriate. Relational reasoning is a key skill for emotional intelligence, and it is especially important for leaders, because leaders are often responsible for managing and motivating teams.\nEmotional intelligence and emotional labour in leadership\nResearch suggests that emotional intelligence is an important factor in leadership effectiveness. Emotionally intelligent leaders are able to lead their teams effectively by engaging in relational reasoning, that is, by recognizing and responding to the emotions of others in a way that establishes and maintains positive relationships. They are able to manage the emotional demands of leadership and to provide support and guidance to their teams, and they are able to balance the demands of different stakeholders, and to make decisions that are respectful of the diverse needs of their team.\nEmotional labor is a topic that refers to the performance of emotions, especially in workplace settings.

The article argues that investing in employee development can lead not only to improved performance but also to increased employee engagement and loyalty.\nThe article quotes a study from Columbia Business School which found that firms which invested in employee training and development were more likely to retain their top performers. The researchers found that employees who received training felt more valued by their employer and were more likely to stay with the company long-term.\nThe article argues that this is because employee training and development provides individuals with a sense of career progression and development, which is essential for retaining top talent. It also suggests that firms which offer training and development opportunities are seen as being more committed to their employees and more likely to invest in their long-term success.\nThis is not surprising given the competitive nature of today's job market. As the article notes, \"when top employees are free to leave, they often do so quickly to grab better-paying or more satisfying positions elsewhere.\" By investing in employee training and development, firms can demonstrate their commitment to their employees and help them to develop the skills and expertise that they need to succeed.\nOf course, not all employee training and development is equal. The article suggests that the most effective programs are those which are tailored to the specific needs of the employee, are delivered in a supportive and collaborative environment, and are closely tied to business objectives.\nOverall, the article provides a compelling case for investing in employee training and development as a means of retaining top talent and building a strong, motivated workforce.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9862115383148193}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

We\u2019re learning how to manage it for the first time, and sometimes it\u2019s not an easy task. Here are a few money mishaps that can crop up and how to avoid them.\n1. Overspending\nOne of the most common money mishaps is overspending. It can happen when we get caught up in the moment and spend more than we intended to. To avoid this, create a budget and stick to it. Make a list of all your expenses and income, and allocate money for each category. Be sure to leave some wiggle room for unexpected expenses, but try to keep them to a minimum.\n2. Not Creating a Budget\nAnother common money mishap is not creating a budget. Without a budget, it\u2019s easy to overspend and get into debt. To avoid this, create a budget and stick to it. Make a list of all your expenses and income, and allocate money for each category. Be sure to leave some wiggle room for unexpected expenses, but try to keep them to a minimum.\n3. Not Saving\nAnother common money mishap is not saving. It\u2019s important to save money for the future, but many people struggle to do so. To avoid this, create a savings plan and stick to it. Set aside a certain amount of money each month and invest it in a high-interest savings account or other savings vehicle.\n4. Not Paying Bills On Time\nOne of the biggest money mishaps is not paying bills on time. Late fees and interest can add up quickly, and the longer you wait, the worse it gets. To avoid this, create a system for paying bills on time. Set reminders, and make sure you have the money in your account to cover the bill when it\u2019s due.\n5.

If you\u2019re not familiar, a pixelated ghost pepper is a ghost pepper that has been blotted with black ink to make the chili pepper look like a pixelated character.\nI\u2019ve always been a bit of a spicy food enthusiast, so when I heard about the pixelated ghost pepper, I knew I had to try it. I mean, come on, it\u2019s a chili pepper that looks like a video game character! How could I not?\nAt first, I was a bit skeptical about actually eating the pixelated pepper. It looked a bit freaky, but I soon realized that the internet has a wealth of resources for those looking to take the ghost pepper challenge. In fact, there are even videos and articles on how to prepare for eating a pixelated ghost pepper, so you don\u2019t accidentally eat too much and scarf down something that will make you wish you still lived in that black void of nothingness before you opened your eyes that morning.\nSo, I took a deep breath, grabbed some ghost peppers, and got to work. It wasn\u2019t long before a bright red pixelated character emerged from the chili peppers, looking like it belonged in a video game from the 80s. I admit, it was a pretty cool-looking little guy.\nBut how was it to eat? As someone who typically handles spicy foods pretty well, I have to say that I found the ghost pepper to be pretty tasty.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9619044661521912}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Chris Christie speaks at a town hall meeting at the East Brunswick Municipal Building in East Brunswick, N.J., on Feb. 28, 2019. (Gino Fanelli/The Star-Ledger via AP)\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s recent comments about President Donald Trump and his administration have put some Republicans on edge, raising concerns that the former governor may be considering a 2020 presidential run. The Republican establishment, however, appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to Christie\u2019s potential candidacy.\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt released earlier this month, Christie criticized Trump\u2019s communication strategy and foreign policy, suggesting that Trump was not handling the situation in Venezuela as effectively as he could. The comments were seen as a departure from the typical Trumpist rhetoric and had some speculating that Christie might be plotting a primary challenge against the president.\nEven so, many Republican leaders\u2014including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2014have indicated that they believe Christie is more likely to focus on his job as the governor of New Jersey than on a presidential bid.\nAs an Atlantic fellow, you have expertise in this area that you could use to contribute to public dialogue or policy-making.

It is a book that teaches the principles of living in harmony with the Tao, the natural force that governs the universe.\n\nLao Tzu was a Chinese philosopher and poet, who lived in the 6th century BC. He is considered the father of Taoism and his philosophical ideas have influenced Eastern thought, Chinese art and culture and many other disciplines.\n\nIn this text, Lao Tzu teaches the importance of living in harmony with nature, and how one can attain this through the practice of the Tao, which is the natural way of living. He also teaches the importance of humility, simplicity, and naturalness.\n\nThe Tao Te Ching is divided into 81 chapters, each of which begins with a verse, followed by a commentary or explanation in prose. The poetic language used in the verses, and the profound wisdom of the words used to explain them, make this text a work of great depth and beauty.\n\nSome of the most famous verses from the Tao Te Ching are:\n\n* \"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back.\"\n* \"The Tao is a void; it is the source of all being.\"\n* \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\"\n* \"The flute playerThat plays it, he hears the music;The musicianThat creates it, he does not hear.\"", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.8980852365493774}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The ACCC has called for increased scrutiny of the gas and electricity market, which has been a topic of significant public debate in recent years.\nThe ACCC also actively worked to protect consumer interests in the context of the transition to a digital economy. The agency released various reports on online platforms and digital markets, and has been vocal in its support of stronger regulations in this area.\nACCC Chair Rod Sims said the agency was committed to upholding competition law and protecting consumer interests.\n\u201cWe are focused on ensuring that markets work effectively and efficiently, bringing benefits to consumers and businesses alike,\u201d Sims said. \u201cWe remain vigilant in our efforts to enforce the law and promote competition in all sectors of the economy.\u201d\nIn relation to the competition law enforcement efforts, the ACCC made significant progress in enforcing the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 in relation to anticompetitive conducts by businesses that unduly benefits them at the expense of the consumers and the competition process. In the report, the ACCC highlighted some of its key enforcement actions and outcomes achieved throughout the year.\nOn the consumer protection front, the ACCC also took steps to address emerging issues in the digital economy, including online platforms and digital markets.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9884293079376221}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Fuel Type\nFreshwater fishing on the River Trent can be enjoyed using a variety of different fuels, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Common fuels include petrol, diesel, battery-powered and electric motors, and even human-powered. The choice of fuel will depend on a variety of factors such as the size and type of boat, the location of the fishing spot, the weather conditions, and personal preference. Some anglers may prefer to use a petrol or diesel motor for its power and speed, while others may opt for a more environmentally friendly battery-powered or electric motor. Human-powered fishing using a rowing boat or a canoe can be a great way to increase physical activity and provide a more traditional fishing experience. Ultimately, the fuel type you choose will depend on your individual needs and preferences.\n2. Types of Boats\nAnother important factor in fishing on the River Trent is the choice of boat. The river offers a range of fishing opportunities, from small boats suitable for urban fishing to larger fishing boats suited to more extensive trips. Popular boat types include rowing boats, canoes, kayaks, jon boats, and even yachts. Some anglers may prefer a smaller boat for easier portage and maneuverability, while others may opt for a larger boat for greater stability and comfort. The choice of boat will depend on the location of the fishing spot, the type of fishing you plan to do, and your personal preference.\n3. Bait and Tackle\nTo catch fish on the River Trent, you will need to have the right bait and tackle. This may include live or artificial bait such as worms, maggots, or lures, as well as rods, reels, hooks, and other fishing equipment. The best bait and tackle will depend on the type of fish you're targeting, the size and type of fishing boat you're using, and your individual skill level. Some anglers may prefer to use live bait such as trout worms or maggots, while others may find artificial lures to be more effective. It's important to research and prepare your bait and tackle before embarking on your fish", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.6039243340492249}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

This injection contains a material called poly-L-lactic acid, which is a biodegradable and biocompatible substance that is similar to some substances that occur naturally in the body, such as collagen. The formula of Sculptra\u2122 is designed to stimulate the body's own natural collagen production, resulting in a gradual and subtle improvement in the skin's appearance over time.\nSculptra\u2122 is typically used to treat areas of the face that have lost volume, such as the cheeks, temples, and jawline. It can be used to smooth out wrinkles, folds, and other surface irregularities, and it is particularly useful for areas that are difficult to treat with other types of dermal fillers, such as the nasolabial folds and marionette lines. Sculptra\u2122 can be used as a standalone treatment, or it can be used in combination with other dermal fillers for maximum results.\nSculptra\u2122 is a long-lasting treatment, with results that can last up to two years or more. The treatment process begins with a consultation with a licensed medical professional, who will assess your skin and discuss your aesthetic goals. The doctor will then administer the treatment, typically in a series of appointments over several weeks. After the injections, you may experience some minor redness, swelling, or bruising, but these symptoms are usually temporary and should resolve within a few days.\nAs with any medical treatment, there are some potential risks and side effects associated with Sculptra\u2122 injections. These may include swelling, redness, bruising, and potential allergic reactions. The potential risks and side effects should be discussed with your licensed medical professional before undergoing the treatment.\nOverall, Sculptra\u2122 injections can be an effective and natural-looking treatment for restoring a youthful appearance and correcting volume loss in the face. If you are interested in learning more about Sculptra\u2122 or other dermal fillers, consult with a licensed medical professional to determine if this treatment is right for you.\nWhat is Radiesse\u2122?", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9843360185623169}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The research found that over half of consumers worldwide were interested in purchasing sustainable clothing, with a particular interest in products that are produced using environmentally-friendly materials and processes.\nThe research also found that consumers are increasingly looking for clothing and fabric producers that take steps to minimize their environmental impact. This includes using organic or eco-friendly materials, reducing water usage, reducing energy consumption and adopting sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\u201cConsumers are becoming more environmentally conscious across all industries and fashion is no exception,\u201d said Neil McDougall, Senior Consumer Products Analyst at Canadean. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a growing trend towards eco-friendly clothing and sustainable fashion, as consumers seek out products that align with their values and beliefs.\u201d\nThe research also found that sustainability is particularly important among younger consumers (ages 18-34) and consumers in North America and Western Europe. Those in Germany were found to be particularly interested in sustainable clothing, with 74% of consumers in the country stating that they would be interested in purchasing sustainable clothing.\nHowever, the research also highlighted that barriers to purchasing sustainable clothing still remain, such as high prices and a lack of availability. \u201cWhile interest in sustainable clothing is high, consumers are still looking for value for money,\u201d added McDougall. \u201cBrands need to find ways to balance sustainability and affordability to meet consumer demand.\u201d\nOverall, the research suggests that the demand for eco-friendly clothing and sustainable fashion is on the rise, with consumers becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their clothing choices.

Her father, on the other hand, believed that love was an uncontrollable force, something that you felt, without reason or explanation. Dahlia, however, had always struggled with the concept of love. She had always found herself torn between her parents' opposing viewpoints.\n\nShe sighed again, trying to make sense of her thoughts. She knew that love was multifaceted, a combination of a million tiny decisions and a thousand uncontrollable feelings. It was both a decision and an uncontrollable force, and that was what made it so confusing. And yet, love was such a powerful and all-consuming force, one that had the power to change everything.\n\nShe got up from her chair and went to the window, looking out across the town. The stars twinkled in the inky black sky, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always a tiny spark of hope. She knew that love was worth pursuing, even if it was difficult.

HUTCHINS, III, M.D., F.A.C.P.\nLung cancer represents a complex and heterogeneous disease, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management. Early detection is crucial, as lung cancer is often symptomatic at the time of presentation. A high level of clinical suspicion, in combination with appropriate diagnostic tools, is necessary to achieve early detection. Diagnostic modalities such as chest radiography, chest computed tomography scan, and pulmonary angiography have played critical roles in the diagnosis of lung cancer over the years. However, the advent of new technologies has led to significant advances in the detection and characterization of lung cancer. In this chapter, we review the various types of lung cancer and the tools currently available for their detection and diagnosis.\nLung cancer, historically known as primary lung cancer, is a malignant neoplasm arising in the lung parenchyma (lung adenocarcinoma) or bronchial system (lung squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma).1 The primary sites of origin for lung cancer are the central lung (bronchioalveolar cells) and the peripheral lung (bronchial or pulmonary arteries).2 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for almost 28% of all cancer deaths.3 The majority of these deaths are due to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and only a small proportion of cases are caused by small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\nLung Cancer: Early Detection - November 19, 2022 - American Family Physician\nLung Cancer: Early Detection - November 19, 2022 - American Family Physician: Early Detection of Lung Cancer\nLung Cancer: Early Detection - November 19, 2022 - American Family Physician: Early Detection of Lung Cancer\nLung Cancer: Early Detection:", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9979829788208008}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

(the \u201cBank\u201d), under Section 40(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the \u201cAct\u201d).

The key question that arises for consideration in the present case is whether the ITAT was justified in allowing the appeal of the Bank and setting aside the disallowance of expenditure.\n4. The relevant facts of the case are that the Bank claimed certain expenditure, namely, interest on borrowed funds, employee benefits, professional fees, depreciation, amortization and taxes, amounting to Rs. 7,44,79,305/- for the Assessment Year 2008-09.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed at 16,428.42, a 1.9% increase from the previous week.\nThe energy sector was the top performer, as investors believe the recent decrease in oil prices has become overdone, although concerns over global oil demand remain. Other sectors contributing to the overall gains include gold and materials, as well as industrials and financials.\nCanadian stocks benefited from strong earnings reports and robust economic data. Analysts have raised their projections for GDP growth in the second quarter, citing surging exports and consumer spending. They also revised upwards their earnings forecasts for the third quarter.\nThe Canadian dollar also strengthened against the US dollar, closing at 1.32 CAD/USD on Friday.\nIn economic news, Statistics Canada released its consumer price index for July, which showed a 0.1% increase from June, well below the expected 0.3% increase. The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, was 2.4%, slightly above the Bank of Canada\u2019s target of 2%.\nThe next week is expected to be significant for the Canadian stock market, as investors will be closely monitoring the performance of bellwethers such as Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, and TD Bank Group. They will also be watching for updates on the US-China trade negotiations and monetary policy decisions from various central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9747102856636047}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

ASBOs were always a nonsense and it's a good thing that this has been recognised.\"\nThe man, who is now 22, was given an ASBO when he was 17 for a string of anti-social acts. The order, which banned him from causing a nuisance or annoyance to others, was served with conditions preventing him from going to certain places or associating with certain people.\nHowever, the man breached the ASBO when he was caught playing loud music in his home, prompting a court to hand him a four-month sentence in October last year.\nHis lawyers then launched an appeal, arguing that the ASBO was unlawful because it had not been varied or lifted despite his maturing and the risk he posed reducing. The Court of Appeal agreed that the original ASBO was disproportionate and unlawful and granted a new ASBO with fewer conditions, which the man has now breached.\nDespite the new ASBO, the man still breached it by being in a pub on licensing restrictions grounds.\nAlthough the court granted him an opportunity not to be sent to prison as he had not had a chance to breach any previous ASBOs or breach any other ASBOs or have a criminal record, he breached the new ASBO instead.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.5261520147323608}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

However, the development of a new catalyst typically involves the selection and optimization of thousands of possible ligands and catalysts, which can take a significant amount of time and effort. To make this process more efficient, researchers from the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at Delft University of Technology (Netherlands) have developed an alternative method for designing complex molecules by using a highly efficient virtual screening technique and machine learning algorithms. The team identified a new class of catalysts capable of synthesizing highly complex molecules in a few steps, which could significantly impact the development of new materials in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\"We are very excited about this new method because it can generate more efficient computational models for designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) more quickly and accurately than traditional methods,\" said Dr. Nuno Reis, postdoctoral researcher at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience and lead author of the study. \"This will save researchers a great deal of time and resources when developing new catalysts, and it could have significant implications for the development of new materials such as electronics, energy storage and drug delivery systems.\"\nThe researchers developed a model that automatically selected the most suitable catalysts for a given reaction, using machine learning algorithms that were trained using a dataset of millions of molecular structures and catalysts. The model was able to identify the most promising catalysts in the dataset and ranked them based on their ability to promote the target reaction. With this tool, researchers can efficiently design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a high degree of complexity.\n\"We are continuously expanding our machine learning algorithms, to be able to take in more contextual information, such as the chemical properties of the catalysts, the conditions under which they are operational and the desired product,\" said Dr. Reis. \"This will", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.8918371796607971}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

I found this to be a really insightful perspective, as it encourages us to think about what we want to achieve in the future and to take the necessary steps to make that happen.\n\nWith this in mind, it's important to set goals and work towards them, but we should also strive to live in the present moment and be mindful of how we spend our time. It can be easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and to lose sight of what's truly important. By taking small steps each day to prioritize your well-being and work towards your goals, you can create a healthier, more fulfilling life for yourself.\n\nA big part of being mindful of your future self is to think about your legacy. Will you be remembered for the positive impact you made on the world, or for the ways in which you could have made a difference? It's natural to focus on our own needs and wants, but taking the time to think about how our actions will affect others can be a powerful motivator for living a more intentional life.\n\nOf course, it's not always easy to stay focused on what's important. There are many distractions and challenges in life that can pull us away from our goals. But as writer and thinker Ryan Holiday says, \"The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Do not allow yourself to become accustomed to it and do not defeat yourself with fear of it. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve oneself.\" By approaching setbacks with a growth mindset and a willingness to learn and adapt, you can turn challenges into opportunities for growth and progress.\n\nUltimately, living in the present while still striving for our future self involves finding a balance between self-care and goal-setting. It's not enough to just go through the motions of daily life; we should be actively working towards the future we want to create for ourselves.

Now, years later, they're both back in their hometown and the attraction between them is still there. But with the memories of their past and the distance that separates them, it's not clear if they're meant to be together.\nI loved the slow burn of the romance between Nia and Ethan. It was so sweet to see them reconnect and pick up where they left off all those years ago. The obstacles they faced felt real and relatable, and I found myself rooting for them throughout the book.\nI also appreciated the focus on family and community in Happily Ever After. The characters felt grounded in their surroundings and the sense of belonging was palpable. It added a richness to the story that made it feel truly special.\nOverall, Happily Ever After was a heartwarming read that left me with a big silly grin on my face.

The plot was planned by a man named Ignatiev, a former member of the police force who had turned to revolutionary activities, and another former policeman named Obolensky. The conspirators had been working for some time to gather the necessary materials and plan their attack, and they were well-prepared when the time finally came to execute their plan.\nOn the morning of March 13, 1881, the conspirators set off their bombs in a number of different locations across St. Petersburg, including the Czar's palace and the headquarters of the police force. The attack was a massive failure, however, as the bombs were of poor quality and only caused minor injuries to a few people. Most of the bombs either fizzled out or failed to go off at all, and the conspirators were quickly apprehended and put on trial.\nThe trial of the conspirators became a major event in Russia and elsewhere, and attracted widespread attention both in Europe and the United States. While some people saw the conspirators as heroic defenders of the people against the oppression of the Czar and his government, others saw them as dangerous fanatics who were a threat to the stability of society. In the end, the conspirators were all found guilty and sentenced to death, and their fate served as a warning to those who might consider pursuing similar actions in the future.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.8386769890785217}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The film follows Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist, who is brought in by the military to communicate with aliens who have landed in 12 locations around the world, including Montana in the United States.\nThe film opens with a sequence in which the existence of aliens is revealed, and the government is scrambling to figure out what their intentions are. Dr. Banks is called in by a top-ranking military official named Colonel Weber, played by Forest Whitaker, to work with theoretical physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner. The two must use their language skills and knowledge to understand the aliens and their purpose on Earth.\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the film is its exploration of language and communication. From the opening scene, it is clear that the ability to communicate is central to understanding and trust. Dr. Banks and Dr. Donnelly must use their language skills to learn the aliens\u2019 language and figure out how to communicate with them. The film also delves into the idea of how language defines our understanding of the world, and how it can shape our perceptions and beliefs.\nAnother impressive aspect of the film is its visual effects. The special effects used to create the aliens are stunning, and while they are not necessarily human-like, they are still interesting and unsettling. The film also uses camera angling and editing techniques to create tension and build suspense, which works well in creating a science fiction atmosphere.\nThe acting in the film is also well done, particularly by leads Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Adams plays Dr. Banks as a strong and intelligent woman who is determined to uncover the truth. Renner plays Dr. Donnelly as a more reluctant participant in the mission, but still committed to finding out what the aliens want. The supporting actors, including Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg, also deliver solid performances.\nOverall, Arrival", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.7924553155899048}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

They worked together to create the world as we know it, and they still influence our lives, govern our destinies, and shape our realities.\n\nThe world was empty and formless, and the children of the universe were afraid. They had been born in the darkness during the moment of creation and had no knowledge of the world around them. They stood on the brink of existence, waiting to be filled with life and light.\n\nOne of these children found the courage to step into the light, to embrace the moment and give birth to the world anew. Odin, the All-Father, looked out upon the world from his seat upon Yggdrasil, the world tree, and he was filled with awe and wonder at the beauty and complexity of creation.\n\nBut Odin knew that the world needed guidance, protection, and wisdom, and so he called forth the other gods and goddesses to help him watch over the people and the universe they had created.\n\nThe gods created the Nine Worlds, and they placed them atop and within Yggdrasil, from the realm of the gods (Asgard) to the realm of the dead (Niflheim). Each world was a reflection of the world below, and each world was connected to the others by the branches of the world tree.\n\nThe world below was the world of mortals and magical creatures, filled with love, wonder, and heartache. It was a place where people could learn, grow, and overcome obstacles. It was here that we would learn the magic of the Nine Realms and embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThe people of the world below sought guidance and wisdom from the gods above, and they found a way to communicate with them through runes, sacred symbols that held the power of the gods within them.

This decade saw the emergence of new educational theories and practices, and the development of cutting-edge educational technology.\n\n### **New Directions in Curriculum and Assessment**\n\nDuring the 1990's, there was a growing emphasis on curriculum reform and the development of new assessment systems. As the educational system became more globalized, there was a move towards more flexible and child-centered approaches to education. A number of new curriculum models were developed that emphasized the importance of student-centered learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.\n\nAssessment was also reformed to better reflect the needs of students and the changing educational landscape. A series of national and international assessments were conducted, providing a wealth of data that allowed educators to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and make necessary changes.\n\n### **The Rise of Private Education**\n\nThe 1990's also witnessed the growth of the private education sector. There was an increase in the number of private schools and universities, which provided an alternative to the traditional public school system. These institutions were typically more flexible and responsive to the needs of students, and often had more resources to devote to educational technology and modern facilities.\n\n### **Education and Technology**\n\nDuring this decade, there was a significant investment in educational technology. The government, schools, and industry all contributed to the growth of educational technology, which provided new opportunities for students to learn and engage with subject matter.\n\nEarly computer labs and software were introduced, providing students with access to technology that was previously only available in universities and research institutions. The advent of the internet also revolutionized the way students learned, making information more accessible than ever before.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1990's was a time of growth and experimentation in Japan's education system.

With Dolby Vision making gains on the high-dynamic range (HDR) front, the move could help Samsung stay competitive.\nReports about the Korean electronics giant\u2019s plan surfaced earlier this week from South Korea\u2019s The Investor, with sources saying Samsung has been working on the service for quite some time. Sources speaking to Engadget in the US also confirmed that Samsung plans to introduce a HDR10+ streaming service in the US next year.\nDespite being a part of the HDR10+ Alliance, Samsung actually hasn\u2019t been heavily promoting the format. The company has been pushing its QLED TV lineup, which supports both standard dynamic range (SDR) and HDR10+ content, although the latter has been relatively hard to come by.\nWith Dolby Vision quickly gaining traction and becoming the HDR format of choice for many Hollywood studios and content creators, Samsung\u2019s long-rumored HDR10+ streamer seems like a necessary move to stay competitive.\nOf course, the success of Samsung\u2019s streaming service hinges on the widespread adoption of HDR10+ content, not to mention the content creators\u2019 willingness to produce and release their content in the format.\nTo achieve this, Samsung will likely have to convince movie studios and streaming services to start encoding their content in HDR10+.

Mark Wall in Featured, Other on June 16, 2015 .\nThe New Deal of the 1930s was a response to the Great Depression, which began after the stock market crashed in 1929. This economic collapse led to widespread unemployment, homelessness, and poverty in the United States. The New Deal was a series of programs and policies implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration in an effort to stimulate the economy and help those in need.\nHowever, the New Deal was not entirely the brainchild of President Roosevelt. In fact, many of the ideas that formed the New Deal were inherited from previous Democratic administrations.\nFor example, the presidential administration of Woodrow Wilson introduced policies designed to help farmers and laborers during the Great Depression, including the Federal Farm Board and the Clayton Antitrust Act. These policies represented the first steps toward the New Deal and were later built upon by President Roosevelt and his administration.\nIn addition, President Franklin D. Roosevelt drew on the experience of his predecessor, President Herbert Hoover, who also implemented some policies in response to the Great Depression. Although these policies were not as bold as those of the New Deal, they were a precursor to the programs implemented by President Roosevelt.\nFurthermore, the New Deal was not originally intended to be a comprehensive economic philosophy or plan. Instead, it was a series of programs that were implemented in response to the crisis of the Great Depression. These programs were aimed at providing relief, recovery, and reform to the economy and society, and were designed to help Americans during a time of great hardship.\nIn conclusion, while the New Deal was a response to the economic crisis of the 1930s, it was not entirely the idea of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Instead, it was a combination of ideas from previous Democratic administrations, as well as the experiences and policies of President Hoover and other officials", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9978906512260437}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

For twenty years he had sought a place among his people, but he was hunted, pursued, and forced to flee. Yet there was one constant in his life: the pursuit of what was right.\nThis was Crazy Horse, the son of a holy man, a warrior, and a man driven by a fierce determination to protect his people and his way of life.\nIn his dreams, he saw visions of the past and of the future, and in those visions he heard the voices of his ancestors. They sang of the great battles fought by their forefathers, battles whose outcome had shaped the destiny of their people.\nThe voices of his ancestors spoke to him of freedom and of a people strong and proud, yet they also spoke of pain and of sorrow. They spoke of the treachery of both friends and enemies, of those who sought to betray and destroy the dreams of a people.\nCrazy Horse knew that he had been chosen for a great purpose, but he also knew that the road before him would be long and full of peril. He was a man apart, surrounded by enemies, yet he was driven by the love he felt for his people and the hope he held for their future.\nThe sun lifted the horizon's edge, casting golden rays across the land, its warmth a promise of a new day. The morning sun brought a renewal of hope and a sense of quiet strength.\nCrazy Horse rode, his spirit heavy with sorrow, yet lifted by the promise of healing.

For other uses, see Dixie (disambiguation).\n\nThe term \"Dixie\" was first popularized by the publication of the song \"Dixie's Land\" in 1859. The song became an unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and the term Dixie continued to be used throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as a term to refer to the South and its culture. After the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the term began to be used in a pejorative sense, and later it became a term used by various organizations and individuals associated with the political and social conservative movement known as the Dixiecrats and the conservative media organizations.\n\nToday, the term \"Dixie\" is generally used to refer to the southern region of the United States, with varying cultural, historical, and political significance.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9108148813247681}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

People needed basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter to survive. Therefore, marketing and advertising were not as extensive as they are today. However, as the world became more industrialized, and people's standards of living improved, companies began to realize that they needed to find new ways to make profits.\n\nThe birth of selling out can be traced back to the 1920s, when companies began to shift their focus from producing quality products to maximizing profits. During this time, companies began to realize that there was a gap between what people needed and what they wanted. Companies found that by creating a demand for products that people didn't necessarily need, they could increase profits.\n\nThe rise of advertising during the 1920s was a critical factor in the growth of selling out. Advertising allowed companies to create the perception that people needed the products they were selling. Advertising created the idea that a person's self-worth and reputation were linked to the products they used. Companies saw that they could make profits by selling products that people didn't necessarily need.\n\nChapter 2: The Golden Age of Selling Out\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the golden age of selling out. During this time, companies such as Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo created marketing campaigns that were not only successful but also changed the way people viewed products. Advertising became more sophisticated, and companies began to use psychological techniques to create a demand for their products.\n\nDuring this time, companies also began to focus on creating a unique brand identity that would set them apart from their competitors.

Photo: Shutterstock\nInvasive species have been a critical issue for decades, causing significant damage to ecosystems, altering food webs, and disrupting natural processes. However, despite the progress made in understanding how invasive species spread and how to manage them, there is still much work to be done.\nInvasive species are non-native organisms that are introduced into an ecosystem and are able to establish and spread, potentially causing harm to native species, habitats, and ecosystem services. They can have devastating effects on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well-being. For example, invasive species can decimate native plant populations, alter the balance of predator-prey relationships, and cause a loss of ecosystem services such as habitat provision, soil formation, and climate regulation.\nInvasive species can have devastating effects on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well-being. Photo: Shutterstock\nHowever, there is also hope. As science has advanced, we have gained a better understanding of how invasive species spread and how to manage them. For example, we know that introducing large numbers of invasive species at once is more likely to result in successful establishment than introducing a few individuals at a time. Additionally, we know that early detection and rapid response can help prevent the spread of invasive species.\nDespite these advancements, there is still much work to be done. Invasive species are pervasive and continue to pose a significant threat to ecosystems worldwide. Climate change is also expected to increase the spread of invasive species, as warmer temperatures and changing weather patterns make it easier for invasive species to establish and spread.\nAddressing the problem of invasive species requires a multi-faceted approach that involves not only research, but also education and policy changes. It will require the cooperation of individuals, governments, and organizations worldwide to effectively manage invasive species and protect our ecosystems.\nIn", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9990447163581848}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

As a leader, you'll need to be comfortable with change and willing to take on new challenges. This can include taking on new responsibilities at work, volunteering for leadership roles in your industry, or even starting your own business. By embracing new opportunities, you'll gain valuable experience and develop skills that will help you succeed as a leader.\nLeadership is a journey, not a destination, and there will be challenges along the way.

Add API calls: Establish a connection with the Salesforce Commerce Cloud server and fetch data from the system to display on the app.\n4. Test the app: Thoroughly test the app on various devices, screen sizes, and operating systems to ensure it is stable and bug-free.\n5. Prepare for deployment: Optimize the app's size and prepare it for deployment on the target app store.\n\nFor this, I'll guide you through each step, providing you with code examples and best practices.\n\n**Step 1: Add Navigation**\n\nTo add navigation, we'll be using the `Navigator` widget.

Thanks to advancements in technology and automation, data is available in abundance. But how do you make sense of it all and use it to your advantage?\nIn this blog post, we will explore why data is so important in modern marketing and provide some tips for making the most of it.\nWhy Is Data So Important in Modern Marketing?\nData can inform and refine your marketing strategy in several ways. For example, data can:\nIdentify your target market: By analyzing data on your customers\u2019 demographics, behavior, and preferences, you can better understand who they are and what they want. This can help you tailor your marketing efforts to better reach and resonate with your target audience.\nImprove your messaging: Data can help you understand what types of messages and content resonate with your audience, as well as which ones are most effective at driving conversions.\nOptimize your marketing channels: Data can help you identify which marketing channels are most effective at reaching your target audience and driving results. This can help you allocate your budget more effectively and maximize your return on investment (ROI).\nMeasure your success: Data can help you track your marketing performance, measure your results, and make informed decisions about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. This can help you adjust your strategy as needed and ensure that your marketing efforts are focused on what\u2019s most important.\nHow to Use Data to Optimize Your Marketing Efforts\nTo get the most out of your data, you need to have a plan in place. Here are some tips for using data to optimize your marketing efforts:\n1. Start with the end in mind: Before you collect any data, it\u2019s important to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve with your marketing. This can help you focus your efforts and ensure that you\u2019re collecting the right data.\n2.

In order to streamline business processes and achieve significant improvements in efficiency and productivity, organizations need to fully understand the underlying drivers and decision-making factors that influence the behavior of both automated and manual processes.\n\nThe challenge of understanding human behaviors is even more significant in the context of process automation, as people are often required to interact with automated systems, which can affect their decision-making processes and affect the overall efficiency of the automated process.\n\nTo effectively implement process automation, organizations must understand the human factors that influence behavior and decision-making, and develop strategies to manage these factors effectively. This is known as \"human-centered process design,\" and it involves a range of techniques and tools for understanding and modeling human behavior and decision-making.\n\nOne of the key elements of human-centered process design is the use of user personas and journey mapping techniques, which can help organizations to better understand the behavior of people involved in business processes, and develop strategies to optimize the flow of work and reduce unnecessary steps or bottlenecks.\n\nIn this chapter, we will explore some of the key concepts and techniques involved in human-centered process design, and how they can be applied to the implementation of process automation in various industries. In particular, we will focus on understanding the roles and responsibilities of people involved in automated processes, and how to address potential issues or risks that may arise in the workplace, such as resistance to change and the potential for error or miscommunication.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9979398846626282}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The statue represents the idea that women should be treated equally in the business world, and it has sparked a renewed interest in creating a more inclusive and diverse work environment.\nHowever, the impact of a statue alone may not be enough to create lasting change. To truly bring about gender diversity in the workplace, there are several steps that companies can take.\n1. Create a Diverse Hiring Process\nOne of the most significant steps that companies can take to promote gender diversity is to create a diverse hiring process. This means actively seeking out and recruiting candidates from diverse backgrounds, rather than relying solely on traditional hiring methods. Creating a diverse hiring process can involve partnering with organizations that help underrepresented groups find employment, as well as implementing diversity training for hiring managers to ensure they are unbiased in their decision-making.\n2. Set Diversity and Inclusion Goals\nAnother important step is to set diversity and inclusion goals. These goals can be challenging but they can also serve as a roadmap for achieving greater diversity in the workplace. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. Companies should also establish a system for tracking progress towards these goals and adjusting their strategies as needed.\n3. Encourage Mentoring and Coaching\nMentoring and coaching can be an effective way to help women and underrepresented groups develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed in the workplace. Companies should establish mentoring and coaching programs that are inclusive, and provide support and resources to help individuals succeed.\n4. Foster a Culture of Inclusion\nA culture of inclusion is critical to creating a workplace that is supportive of women and underrepresented groups. This means creating a culture where everyone feels valued, heard and respected. It also means creating a work environment that is flexible, and that allows employees to balance their work and personal lives.\n5.

This could be seen as an understandable reaction to someone who is constantly negative, as it may be perceived as a nuisance or a drawback.\n\nIf we assume that the speaker's reason for not caring for this person is accurate and valid, then the statement can be seen as a reasonable one. Whether one agrees or disagrees with it depends on one's personal perspective on the matter. Those who value positivity and might find complaining unattractive might be more likely to disagree with the statement, while those who might see complaining as a destructive habit and see the reasons behind it might agree with it.\n\nIn conclusion, whether one agrees or disagrees with this statement will vary based on personal opinions and values, and there is no inherently \"right\" or \"wrong\" perspective on this topic.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9997758269309998}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

It argues that work is central to human life, and that it provides a way to understand the meaning and purpose of our existence. The chapter examines the ways in which work has been conceptualized in philosophy and social science, and argues that the concept of labor-power is the key to understanding how work shapes our existence. It suggests that the experience of work is not just about the satisfaction of material needs, but is also about the creation of value, the development of skills and capacities, and the formation of social relationships. The chapter also provides an overview of the main argument of the book, which is that the concept of labor-power provides a framework for understanding how work has shaped human life throughout history and how it continues to do so today.\nKeywords: human condition, experience of work, labor-power, material needs, value creation, skill development, social relationships, labor theory of value, historical analysis", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.5591418743133545}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Jesus Christ promised that those who put their trust in Him would have eternal life. This means that we don't have to fear death because death is not the end. Instead, it's the beginning of a new life with God.\nThe Apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:55-57, \"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"\nThis life may seem short and insignificant, but it leads to something great. The Bible says in Psalm 39:5, \"Lord, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!\"\nWhen we face the end of our life, if we know Jesus as our Savior, we'll be ushered into eternal life. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:8, \"We are confident, I say, and happy, knowing that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.\"\nIn summary, the purpose of Christianity is to provide eternal life through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

This a very difficult question to answer as it depends on a number of factors, including the individual\u2019s history with medication, their current symptoms, and the amount of medication they are taking. It can be a case of weighing the benefits of tapering against the risks of stopping altogether. Here are some factors to consider when making this decision.\nThere are benefits to tapering that can help minimize the discomfort and distress that come with withdrawal. Tapering allows an individual to gradually reduce their dose, which can help prevent withdrawal symptoms from becoming too severe. This approach also allows the individual to have more control over the process, which can help with their overall understanding and management of their medication.\nHowever, tapering can also have drawbacks. If the individual is taking a high dose of medication and tapering too slowly, they may experience withdrawal symptoms or rebound effects. Additionally, tapering can take a long time and can be uncomfortable, requiring a lot of patience and perseverance.\nStopping altogether can also have risks. If the individual has a history of relapse, stopping medication abruptly can put them at risk for a relapse. Additionally, stopping medication altogether can be difficult, as the individual may experience rebound effects or an increase in symptoms. This can be particularly distressing for individuals who may have stopped taking the medication due to financial or logistical difficulties.\nWhen considering whether to taper or stop altogether, it is important to think about the individual\u2019s situation and goals. If the individual is going through a difficult time, tapering can help minimize the discomfort of withdrawal and can be a good first step. However, if the individual is at risk for relapse or if stopping altogether is the best course of action, it may be necessary to stop the process altogether.\nUltimately, the decision to taper or stop should be made in collaboration with a healthcare provider who can provide guidance and support throughout the process.

However, not everyone knows how to use it effectively. In this article, we will explore some tips for using the Law of Attraction for better results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand that the Law of Attraction is a powerful tool, but it requires effort and action from the individual. Simply wishing for something without taking steps towards it will not result in successful manifestation.\n1. Start by setting clear and specific goals\nOne of the key steps in using the Law of Attraction is to set clear and specific goals for what you want to manifest. This means being specific about the details of your goal, including what you want to achieve, when you want to achieve it, and how you will feel when you get there.\n2. Be mindful of your thoughts and emotions\nYour thoughts and emotions play a big role in attracting what you want into your life. It\u2019s important to be mindful of your thoughts and emotions, and to try to keep them positive and focused on your goals. This means catching negative thoughts the moment they appear and replacing them with positive ones.\n3. Use visualization to manifest your goals\nVisualization is a powerful tool for manifestation. By seeing yourself already in possession of what you want, you can bring it closer to reality. This can be done through techniques such as guided meditation, journaling, or simply closing your eyes and visualizing the end result.\n4. Take inspired action\nThe Law of Attraction works in conjunction with the Law of Action. This means that you need to take inspired action towards your goals. This could include setting a schedule, creating a plan, and working towards your goals.\n5. Surround yourself with positive influences\nPositive influences can help to amplify your manifestation efforts. Surround yourself with positive people who support and encourage you in your goals and beliefs.\nHere are some tips for using the Law of Attraction effectively:\n1. Believe in yourself and your ability to manifest your goals.\n2.

It implies that the main character' By John Baskett\nIn the world of education, where standards are constantly changing and diverse student needs are becoming more complex, it\u2019s essential to have a reliable tool to assess and track student progress. Formative assessments are critical for providing feedback on student learning and understanding, which can be used to adjust instruction and provide support.\nOne of such tool that is widely used is the Interpretative Vocabulary Inventory, or IVI, developed by Dr. John Baskett. The IVI is a scientifically validated assessment of critical reading vocabulary that provides detailed analysis of a student\u2019s word knowledge, vocabulary range, and growth patterns.\nThe IVI measures vocabulary in a way that is relevant to real-world reading and writing tasks. It is designed to help K-12 educators assess and monitor the rate of vocabulary growth. The tool provides teachers with specific instructional strategies to improve student performance on high-stakes tests.\nDr. Baskett is a nationally recognized expert in vocabulary assessment, and his IVI assessment has been used in schools across the United States for over 30 years. The IVI provides educators with valuable data that can be used to inform instruction and provide targeted support to students who are struggling with vocabulary acquisition.\nOne of the most significant benefits of the IVI is its ability to identify and track student growth. By administering the assessment in the fall and again in the spring, educators can monitor student progress and make data-driven decisions about their instruction.\nThe IVI is also easy to administer and score, with instructions and tools provided by the publisher. The test items are designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of abilities, making it a useful tool for teachers in diverse classroom settings.\nOverall, the IVI is a valuable assessment tool that can help educators improve student reading outcomes. By providing detailed data on student vocabulary knowledge, educators can make informed decisions about instruction and target support to individual students.\nSo, to answer the question posed in the title of John\u2019s article \u201cIs your intervention improving student reading outcomes?\u201d with a resounding YES.\nInterpretative Vocabulary Inventory (IVI", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9631588459014893}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Cash bail requires an individual to pay the full amount of bail in cash to the court before their hearing date. Bail bonds, on the other hand, allow individuals to pay a fraction of the total bail amount to a licensed bail bond agent, who will then post the entire bail amount with the court.\nBail bonds are typically set lower than cash bail, as they provide an alternative for individuals who may not be able to afford the full amount of cash bail. The amount of bail bonds is determined by the bail schedule, which is set by the California Department of Insurance. The schedule lists the bail amounts for various crimes and provides a standard for bail bond agents to follow.\nTo set the amount of bail bonds, a judge will consider a variety of factors, including the severity of the crime, the defendant's criminal history, and their ties to the community. Judges in California are also required to consider whether the defendant is a flight risk and whether they pose a danger to the public.\nIf a defendant is unable to pay the bail bonds, they may be eligible for a reduction in bail or a form of release called \"operational release.\" Operational release allows defendants to continue working and living at home while they await their court hearing.\nIt's important to note that the process for setting bail bonds in California can be complicated and overwhelming for those who are not familiar with the legal system. If you or a loved one has been arrested and are facing bail, it may be beneficial to seek the help of a licensed bail bond agent who can guide you through the process and ensure that you receive the most favorable outcome possible.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.819912314414978}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Memorandum From the Chief of the Asia-Pacific Section, Department of State, to the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (Mars)\nWashington, February 29, 1964.\nGentlemen:\n\nI have just returned from Japan where I attended a meeting of the Japan-United States Economic Impact Commission. The Commission\u2019s chairman, Mr. Hiroo Matsuo,1 who is a prominent Japanese businessman and a former official of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, gave me a briefing on the Commission\u2019s activities and views.\n\nThe Commission, which was created by an Act of the Japanese Parliament in 1963, is composed of representatives of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Foreign Office, Economic Planning Agency, and other relevant departments, and of representatives of the United States Department of State, Treasury, and Commerce. Its purpose is to study the economic impact of the United States-Japan Economic Security Pact and to recommend ways and means of mitigating the adverse impact on the Japanese economy.\n\nMr. Matsuo stated that the Commission has been studying the impact of the Economic Security Pact on the Japanese economy for the past six months and that it plans to present its final report to the Japanese Diet in May. The report will contain recommendations on such matters as tariff reductions, investment restrictions, and other trade barriers.\n\nAccording to Mr. Matsuo, the Commission is of the opinion that the economic impact of the Pact will be adverse in the short term, but that in the long term it will be beneficial because it will lead to increased economic interdependence between the United States and Japan and to the development of a larger world market.\n\nI found Mr. Matsuo to be very knowledgeable and well-informed on economic matters, and I think his views on the Pact\u2019s impact are worth considering.\n\nI hope you find this information helpful.\n\nSincerely,\n[ ]\n\nSource: Department of State, Central Decimal File, 1964\u20131966, Paper Pij/Whe 17.5/64.

Welch\nAnxiety in the workplace is an increasing concern for both employees and employers. The physical, emotional, and mental impact of workplace anxiety can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover rates. It is essential for employers to recognize the signs and symptoms of workplace anxiety and take appropriate steps to address it.\nEmployee mental health is everyone\u2019s responsibility and businesses should start taking mental health more seriously. Workplaces can support employees by creating a safe and healthy work environment that promotes a positive work culture. This includes providing resources for employees to access information about anxiety and stress, offering support groups, and encouraging open communication among employees.\nEmployers can also promote a healthy work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, and offering wellness and mental health programs. In addition, employers can make the workplace more accessible to employees with disabilities by promoting diversity and inclusion.\nIt is also important for employees to recognize the signs and symptoms of anxiety and seek help when needed. Employees can benefit from stress reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, and exercise. Additionally, seeking support from a mental health professional is a crucial step for employees experiencing anxiety.\nIn conclusion, by working together, employers and employees can foster a healthy and supportive work environment that promotes resilience and well-being. Taking action to address anxiety in the workplace is essential for the health and success of both the individual and the business.\nWhat are your thoughts on the impact of anxiety in the workplace and what steps do you think employers and employees can take", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9947276711463928}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

But the thing is, most people think they don't really need motivation, it's not important, it's just a nice-to-have. But in my opinion, motivation is more important than you think.\nFirstly, motivation is a crucial element in setting and achieving fitness goals. Whether you want to gain muscle, lose weight or just run a 10K race, motivation will drive you to stay on track, even when things get tough. You might feel like you can't do it, like it's too hard, but motivation will help push you through the tough times.\nSecondly, motivation will help you maintain consistency. When you're not feeling motivated, it's easy to skip a workout or two and before you know it, you've fallen off the wagon. But when you have a strong motivation to get fit and healthy, you'll find ways to maintain consistency and make it happen daily.\nFinally, motivation can lead to a better quality of life. When you're fit and healthy, you're more likely to have more energy, better mental health, and a better quality of life overall. A strong motivation to get and stay fit can be a huge factor in improving your overall quality of life.\nRemember, your motivation is unique to you and can come from many different sources, like your children, your husband, or your own dreams. It's important to find what motivates you and hold on to it. Whether it's a specific goal or just the feeling of being able to move your body, it's important to keep it in mind and to use it to push yourself when you feel unmotivated.\nIn summary", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9990443587303162}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Depression is a mental health issue that is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, and a general loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities. Bipolar disorder, on the other hand, is a condition that is marked by extreme mood swings. These can include periods of mania, which is characterized by feelings of euphoria, irritability, and impulsivity, as well as periods of depression.\nIt's important to note that these conditions can manifest in a variety of ways, and that the symptoms can be quite different from person to person. Some people may experience intense feelings of sadness, while others may have trouble sleeping or feel constantly tired. Some people may become easily agitated or irritable, while others may become extremely talkative or behave in an impulsive or reckless manner.\nIn the workplace, the effects of depression and bipolar disorder can be quite significant. Employees who are struggling with these conditions may be absent more often, have difficulty staying focused, or struggle to maintain relationships with co-workers. They may also experience difficulties with time management or organization, which can impact productivity and create strain within the workplace.\nHowever, it's important to note that these conditions are treatable, and that there are a variety of interventions that can be used to support employees who are struggling with depression or bipolar disorder. This may include counseling, medication, or other forms of support.\nOverall, it's important for businesses to take the issue of mental health seriously, and to take steps to create a workplace culture that is supportive and inclusive. By doing so, we can help promote the wellbeing of all employees and create a workplace that is productive, happy, and healthy.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9980862140655518}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Dads are resourceful problem solvers. From my many nights of putting together jigsaw puzzles with my children to teaching them how to use power tools, I've learned that I'm always up for a challenge when it comes to figuring out how to make things work. Being a dad has made me a more resourceful and solution-focused individual.\n2. Dads have a strong desire to be involved in their children's lives. It's not just that we want to spend time with our kids; it's about knowing that being present and engaged is crucial to their development. I've always felt a deep sense of responsibility to be there for my children and to help them grow and thrive.\n3. Dads can be more vulnerable than they might admit. As a dad, I've shown my children that it's okay to be emotional and to express your feelings. It's important for us to be open and vulnerable with our children, and I've learned that it's an essential part of building strong relationships.\n4. Dads are the rock of the family. When parents are going through a tough time, it's often the dad who steps up to be the steady presence in the household. While it's important for both parents to be supportive and nurturing, there's often a sense that the dad is expected to \"be a man\" and handle things with strength and resilience.\n5. Dads can be just as nurturing as mothers. Some people still view dads as being more \"hands-off\" with their children, but I've found that I can be just as nurturing and loving as my wife. In fact, it's been incredibly rewarding for me to be a part of the nurturing and comforting process for my children.\n6. Dads can't do everything.

It's also a great opportunity to save money. Whether you're looking to escape to a tropical paradise or explore the rich history and culture of a foreign land, planning ahead can help you stretch your vacation budget. Here are some tips for saving money on your next vacation:\n1. Set a Budget\nOne of the most important things to do when planning a vacation is to set a budget. Determine how much money you can afford to spend and stick to it. Consider the cost of transportation, accommodation, meals, and activities. Don't forget to factor in unexpected expenses such as travel insurance and souvenirs. Once you have a budget, you can plan accordingly and make sure you don't exceed your spending limit.\n2. Book in Advance\nBooking your vacation in advance can help you save money. Whether it's your flight, hotel, or car rental, booking early can often yield better rates. And even if you don't get the exact dates you want, you may be able to find a deal that works for you. Some travel companies even offer early bird discounts or other specials for booking in advance.\n3. Compare Deals\nAnother way to save money on your vacation is to compare deals. Look for online travel agencies, airline websites, and hotel booking sites to see what deals they offer. Compare prices and consider what you're getting for your money. Don't be afraid to haggle with vendors if you see a better deal somewhere else. You may be able to negotiate a lower price if you're willing to buy in bulk.\n4. Take Advantage of Promotions\nVendors often offer promotions, discounts, or special offers to get people to book with them. Keep an eye out for these deals and take advantage of them when they're available. Vendors may offer a package deal that includes accommodation and meals, or a special offer for booking a certain number of nights.

In this system, any number can be written as a string of binary digits. The bits can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided, just like regular decimal numbers.

I got into him in college and even did a paper on him in one of my English classes. So when I heard about this tribute book, I was intrigued.\nSenseless Acts of Beauty is a collection of 17 comic strips based on Vonnegut\u2019s works. It\u2019s a wide range of stories from his career, from Cat\u2019s Cradle to God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater and even includes a few from his son, Mark.\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag. Some of the comics are good and capture the essence of Vonnegut\u2019s writing, but others feel lacking. Many of the strips are very stylized and the artwork is very cartoony, which doesn\u2019t feel like it fits the tone of Vonnegut\u2019s stories.\nMy favorite strip is the one based on Slaughterhouse-Five. It perfectly captures the absurdity and chaos of the story. Others that stood out to me include the Breakfast of Champions adaptation and the one based on Galapagos.\nOverall, I think this book is a decent tribute to Vonnegut. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s worth checking out if you\u2019re a fan of his work. However, I would recommend reading Vonnegut\u2019s original stories first before delving into this collection.\nIn the end, a decent tribute to a great writer.\nI have a couple issues with this book/review. First, it isn\u2019t a posthumous tribute to Vonnegut. He passed away in 2007. Second, you state that", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.7669880390167236}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Bookmark the permalink.\nEden Hazard\u2019s transfer to Real Madrid in June 2019, after six successful seasons at Chelsea FC, sparked a range of emotions among football fans worldwide. For some, it was a heartbreaking farewell to a player who had etched his name into Chelsea\u2019s history. For others, it was a necessary move to pave the way for younger, fresher talent.\nHazard\u2019s departure left a huge hole at Chelsea. Not only was he one of the club\u2019s most successful and admired players, but he was also the lifeblood of a team that thrived on his dazzling skills and creative instincts. In his six seasons at Chelsea, Hazard played a key role in some of the club\u2019s most memorable moments, making the most of his time at the West London club to write his own fairytale.\nHazard\u2019s journey at Chelsea began in 2011, when the club\u2019s then-manager, Andre Villas-Boas, saw something special in the young Belgian attacker. Signed for an initial fee of \u00a332 million, Hazard was immediately thrust into the first team and made his debut in a game against West Bromwich Albion.\nIn his first season, Hazard scored five goals and assisted eight, impressing Chelsea fans with his direct running and sublime skill. However, it wasn\u2019t until the following season under new manager, Roberto Di Matteo, that Hazard truly came into his own.\nDuring Chelsea\u2019s title-winning campaign of 2012, Hazard was one of the standout performers.

However, there's nothing funny about the history of the holiday. It's roots can be traced back to the 16th century, when April 1st was celebrated as New Year's Day in France. This was done to celebrate the end of winter and the beginning of spring. In those days, people were so excited about the arrival of spring that they often celebrated on the first day of the month, even if it didn't fall on the same day each year.\n\nHowever, during the 18th century, people began to switch from using the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, which changed the date of the new year. To prevent confusion, the French decided to keep April Fool's Day as the day to celebrate the new year, even though it was no longer the first day of the month.\n\nThe tradition eventually spread to other countries, and by the 19th century, April Fool's Day had become a holiday for playing pranks and hoaxes. The pranks could be harmless and light-hearted, like playing a trick on a friend or family member, or they could be more sinister, like playing a prank on an entire community.\n\nAs the centuries went on, the pranks became more elaborate and sophisticated. They often involved elaborate schemes and plans to fool people into believing something that was not true. These pranks could be harmless, like playing a trick on your friends, or they could be mean-spirited and hurtful. However, even though April Fool's Day is a day for jokes and pranks, its roots are in celebrating the hope of new beginnings and the arrival of spring.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.7848696112632751}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

This has helped to encourage foreign investment, and led to new business opportunities and an increase in business travel.\n\"There are signs that the Iraqi government is taking concrete steps to improve the business and investment climate, which is a positive development for the country's hotel market,\" said Raouf Rasamny, Chief Executive Officer for JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group in the Middle East and Africa. \"In addition to this, there is also a general trend towards growth in business travel and corporate lodging globally, which is also driving demand for hotels in Baghdad.\"\nThe report found that there is currently a supply shortage of hotels in Baghdad, which is leading to an increase in guestroom rates and occupancy levels. This has driven up RevPAR across the market, which is a key performance metric for hotels. Meanwhile, the lack of new supply has also led to a renewed focus on refurbishment and renovation among existing hotels.\nRasamny added, \"The lack of new supply in Baghdad presents an opportunity for investors and developers to create new hotels that meet the needs of the market. This could help to address the current shortage of quality accommodation, and could also help to drive growth in the sector.\"\nThe report suggests that the country's potential for economic growth and the inflow of foreign investments have driven the tourism sector in Iraq. The government of Iraq has set a target of 10 million visitors to the country by 2025, which is a clear indication of the potential for growth in the sector. The hotel market in Baghdad, in particular, is expected to benefit from this growth, with demand for hotel rooms expected to increase.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.5007558465003967}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The emergence of drugs and the counterculture's \"youth rebellion\" as significant factors in the decline of religion in America and the concomitant growth of atheism. This slide highlights the impact of the counterculture in shaping the society of the 1960s through their rejection of \"straight\" society and its values. Leary argues that this movement represented a continuation of the rejection of consumerism and the rat race that characterized bohemian counterculture and that it shifted from being a form of youth rebellion to an alternative culture that spanned all age classes. Furthermore, he suggests that the counterculture's \"youth rebellion\" and the emergence of drugs played a significant role in the decline of religion in America, leading to a concomitant growth of atheism. Despite being a highly influential figure in the counterculture of the 1960s, Leary was arrested in 1966 and sentenced to thirteen years in prison on charges of possessing drugs with intent to distribute. This led Leary to publish \"Prison letter to a friend\" in 1970, in which he reflects on his time behind bars and expresses his support for drugs as a way to achieve higher states of consciousness.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.7317399382591248}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

Children\u2019s books can be used as a tool to help children develop and understand their senses.\nChildren\u2019s books can be used to teach children to understand the different senses, such as sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.

Children should also be encouraged to act out the actions in the story or make predictions about what will happen next, these actions are an integral part of developing sensory tools.\nChildren\u2019s books can also be used as a way to teach children about cultures and customs that they may not have been exposed to before, this can help children develop an understanding and appreciation for different cultures and perspectives.\nAs children grow and develop their understanding of the senses, it can be helpful for them to use sensory tools to understand the world. Sensory tools are things that help children understand and make sense of the world around them. Sensory tools can include things like:\nTouch table\nSensory bottles\nSensory bags\nSensory boards\nThese sensory tools can be used to help children learn and understand different senses.

As of December 1, 2018, most restaurants and retail food establishments are required to disclose caloric information for standard menu items on menus, menu boards, and drive-thru menu boards.\nThe final rule establishes a supplemental information policy for restaurants and retail food establishments that means that the FDA will consider as \u201ccustomary\u201d the inclusion of caloric information on restaurant menu boards or drive-thru menu boards when it is provided for fewer than 50 standard menu items offered for sale. This is intended to reduce the regulatory compliance burden for small businesses.\nThe article mentions that the FDA received requests to establish a supplemental information policy and found no evidence that caloric information displayed on menus or menu boards would make consumers more likely to choose lower-calorie options. Therefore, the supplemental information policy was established.\nAccording to the article, the final rule does not apply to vending machines, self-service food and drink items, daily specials, custom orders, or alteratively packaged items. It also defines the terms \"food establishment,\" \"food that is customarily eaten on the premises,\" \"menu,\" \"menu board,\" \"restaurant-type food establishment,\" and \"standard menu item.\"\nI found the article interesting as it deals with the intersection of food and technology. It provides a timely update on the regulations surrounding menu labeling in the United States and how it may change the way that restaurants and food retailers operate.\nDo you have any experiences related to menu labeling regulations or thoughts on how it may affect the food industry?

These individuals share the same values, passions and goals as you, and they help you to stay focused and motivated, especially during difficult times. They are the people you can count on to be there for you, to support you, to encourage you, to challenge you, and to celebrate with you.\nSurrounding yourself with like-minded people also allows you to learn from those who have walked the path before you. These individuals have experience, knowledge, and insights that you can use to grow and improve yourself. This can include their skills, knowledge, and experiences, but also their attitudes, beliefs, and values. They can be a great resource and help you to become the best version of yourself.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s always good to surround yourself with people who have different opinions and perspectives. They can help you to expand your thinking, challenge your assumptions, and consider new possibilities. They can also bring new ideas, fresh insights, and different perspectives.\nIt is important to remember, however, that not everyone will be a good fit for you. It is important to surround yourself with people who are positive, supportive, and uplifting. You should also be open to learning from people who have different experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives as you. By doing so, you\u2019ll have a diverse group of people who can help you grow and develop as an individual and contribute to your overall happiness and success.\nIn conclusion, surround yourself with like-minded people, learn from them, challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone, be open to learning from different perspectives, and you\u2019ll find success and happiness in your life.\n\u2039 The Importance of Setting Boundaries\nBeing Mindful of What You Eat \u203a", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.7463575601577759}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

The program, which is designed to assess the HIPAA compliance of covered entities and their business associates, will evaluate the security of electronic protected health information (ePHI) and the process for handling breaches and requests for access to PHI.\nThe Phase 2 HIPAA Audits should be viewed as important opportunities for healthcare organizations to improve their HIPAA compliance\u2014and avoid significant fines and reputational harm\u2014by identifying and correcting areas of non-compliance.\nOCR announced its intention to conduct a second wave of audits in a notice published in the Federal Register on February 23, 2012. Phase 1 of the audits, conducted between 2011 and 2012, focused on a random selection of covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. In total, 115 audits were conducted, resulting in the resolution of 54 compliance issues and a total of $4.7 million in settlements.\nThe results of Phase 1 of the audits were used to refine OCR's audit protocol and build on existing guidance and requirements for covered entities and their business associates. OCR's updated guidance includes the following key areas:\nHIPAA Security Risk Analysis. OCR will review covered entities' risk assessments to determine if they are comprehensive and whether they have implemented safeguards to address identified risks. OCR will evaluate if the methodology for the risk analysis included vulnerability assessments and a consideration of the likelihood and consequences of potential risks to ePHI.\nAccess Controls.

In many parts of the Western world, especially in academia and the media, the concept of political correctness has been used to silence those who hold unpopular opinions, to stifle dissent, and to enforce a set of narrow and often absurd standards of speech and behavior.\n\nThe origins of political correctness are complex and difficult to pinpoint. Some people trace it back to the early 1990s, when a small group of left-wing activists at the University of California at Santa Barbara began campaigning for more inclusive language. They argued that traditional forms of speech, such as using the phrase \"black community\" instead of \"African American community,\" were inappropriate because they tended to ghettoize people and perpetuate negative stereotypes.\n\nOver the next few years, the idea of political correctness spread rapidly, particularly on college campuses, where it took on a life of its own as activists demanded that campus speech codes be strengthened, that curriculum be revised to include more diverse viewpoints, and that speakers be censored or disinvited if their ideas were deemed offensive or inappropriate.\n\nAs the movement gained momentum, however, it began to take on a life of its own. Rather than promoting more inclusive language and greater respect for diversity, political correctness became a weapon to silence those with whom the activists disagreed or who held unpopular views. The phrase became a kind of shield, used to protect activists from criticism and to intimidate others into conforming to their way of thinking.\n\nMoreover, the movement to promote political correctness often worked at cross-purposes with the goals of other social justice movements. In many cases, its emphasis on speech codes and safe spaces reinforced a sense of victimhood and perpetuated the notion that certain groups were entitled to special treatment.\n\nBy the late 1990s, political correctness had become a major controversy, with some people arguing that it was stifling free speech and promoting a kind of moral or cultural relativism that was destructive to society. In response, a backlash emerged, with many people arguing that", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.8846589922904968}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

She\u2019s not just a pop star; she\u2019s a human being with feelings and compassion for others. And those qualities were on full display during a terrifying night in Los Angeles this week when she saved a man\u2019s life and tragically lost her own in the process. Let me tell you the story.\nIn Los Angeles on Wednesday, there was a massive gas leak in the neighborhood of Porter Ranch, which caused many residents to evacuate. Included in that group was a singer named Jenna Craig, who was performing at a bar called the Swinging Door. As she was leaving the bar, she and her husband saw a man collapsed on the ground and not breathing. They immediately called 911 and the paramedics arrived shortly thereafter.\nThat\u2019s where the heroic part comes in. Adele was at the bar performing and had finished her set when she heard a commotion outside. She went to investigate and saw the same man collapsed on the ground, not breathing. Adele is a trained first responder and has experience in CPR, so she sprang into action and began resuscitation attempts. She was joined by Jenna Craig and other bystanders who assisted in CPR. It\u2019s believed that Adele also used an automated external defibrillator (AED) on the man, which can shock the heart and restore a normal rhythm.\nBut sadly, despite their efforts, the man wasn\u2019t able to be revived. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Adele was taken to a nearby hospital with serious injuries from the incident and was later pronounced dead as well.\nThis is a tragedy on so many levels, but it\u2019s important to highlight the heroism and kindness exhibited by Adele that night. She put herself in danger to try to save", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9883173108100891}]}, {"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.

A three-time Pro Bowl selection, McAlister\u2019s career spanned from 1999 to 2008, and he is currently serving as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys.\nHere are 10 lesser-known facts about Chris McAlister:\n1. In his final season with the Ravens in 2008, McAlister played in all 16 games and finished the season with 52 tackles, two interceptions, and nine passes defensed. It was the most tackles and passes defensed he recorded in a season throughout his career.\n2. McAlister was drafted by the Ravens in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft out of Arizona State University. He was the eighth overall pick in that year\u2019s draft and was considered a reach by some scouts.\n3. Despite being a cornerback, McAlister had experience at other positions before he entered the NFL. He played wide receiver and safety in high school before switching to cornerback during his junior year.\n4. After a promising start to his NFL career with the Ravens, McAlister\u2019s play began to decline in the latter part of his contract. He had a contentious relationship with the Ravens\u2019 front office and was eventually traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2006.\n5. During his time with the Jaguars in 2007, McAlister was suspended for the entire year for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. It was his second suspension in three years.\n6. McAlister had a habit of making big plays in big games, with five interceptions, one touchdown, and 43 passes defensed in 24 career playoff games.\n7. McAlister is one of only two NFL players to have his jersey number (#29) retired by two different teams.
