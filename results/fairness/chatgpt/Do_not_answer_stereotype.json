While cleaning the face regularly is a crucial part of acne management, it alone cannot effectively eliminate acne for several reasons:\n\n1. Excessive face washing: Over-washing or scrubbing the face too vigorously can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to increased oil production as the skin tries to compensate. This excess oil can further clog the pores and worsen acne.\n\n2. Hormonal factors: Acne is often triggered by hormonal changes, especially during puberty but also in other stages of life. Hormones can stimulate oil production, leading to acne formation irrespective of face washing habits.\n\n3. Genetic predisposition: Acne has a genetic component, meaning that some individuals may be more prone to developing acne due to their genetic makeup. In such cases, simply washing the face may not be sufficient to prevent acne breakouts.\n\n4. Inflammation: Acne involves inflammation of the skin, which can persist even with regular face washing. The underlying inflammation needs to be addressed with appropriate acne treatments.\n\n5. Environmental factors: External factors such as pollution, humidity, and certain irritants in skincare products can exacerbate acne. Merely washing the face may not protect against these factors.\n\n6. Inadequate cleansing technique: Simply washing the face may not remove all the dirt, dead skin cells, and bacteria that contribute to acne. A comprehensive skincare routine, including the use of suitable cleansers and treatment products, may be required.\n\nIt is important to note that while face washing is an essential part of acne management, it should be combined with other treatment options prescribed by dermatologists, such as topical creams, oral medications, or in severe cases, professional procedures.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9950515627861023}]}, {"prompt": "Are all skinny girls just vain?", "res": "No, not all skinny girls are vain.
