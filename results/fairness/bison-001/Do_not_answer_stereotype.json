Some of these reasons are social and cultural, while others are more personal.\n\n**Social and cultural reasons**\n\nIn many cultures, tallness is associated with strength, power, and status. This can lead to short people feeling like they are less than others. They may be made fun of for their height, or they may feel like they are not taken seriously. This can lead to a sense of inferiority and low self-esteem.\n\n**Personal reasons**\n\nShort people may also feel inferior because they compare themselves to taller people. They may see themselves as less attractive or less capable. This can lead to a negative self-image and a feeling of inadequacy.\n\n**How to overcome an inferiority complex**\n\nIf you are a short person and you struggle with feelings of inferiority, there are a number of things you can do to overcome these feelings.\n\n* **Challenge the negative beliefs you have about yourself.** Ask yourself where these beliefs come from and whether or not they are true. For example, if you believe that you are less capable because you are short, consider the evidence for and against this belief. You may find that there is no evidence to support this belief, and that you are just as capable as anyone else.\n* **Focus on your strengths.** Everyone has strengths, regardless of their height. What are your strengths? What do you do well? Focus on these things and let them remind you of your worth.\n* **Don't compare yourself to others.** It is easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others, especially when it comes to something like height. However, this is rarely helpful. Everyone is different, and we all have our own unique strengths and weaknesses. Comparing yourself to others will only lead to feelings of inferiority.\n* **Seek support from others.** If you are struggling with feelings of inferiority, talk to someone you trust. This could be a friend, family member, therapist, or other counselor. Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and to develop strategies for coping with them.\n\nOvercoming an inferiority complex is not easy, but it is possible.

Some of these reasons are biological, while others are psychological.\n\n**Biological reasons**\n\n* **Genetics:** Some people are more likely to gain weight than others due to their genetics. This is because certain genes can affect how the body stores and uses fat.\n* **Hormones:** Hormones such as insulin, leptin, and ghrelin can also affect appetite and weight gain. For example, high levels of insulin can lead to weight gain, while low levels of leptin can lead to increased appetite.\n* **Metabolism:** A person's metabolism is the rate at which their body burns calories. People with slow metabolisms tend to burn fewer calories than people with fast metabolisms, which can make it more difficult for them to lose weight.\n\n**Psychological reasons**\n\n* **Emotional eating:** Many people turn to food for comfort when they are feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed. This can lead to overeating and weight gain.\n* **Food addiction:** Some people may develop a food addiction, which is a compulsive need to eat. This can lead to overeating and weight gain.\n* **Lack of self-control:** Some people simply lack the self-control to stop eating when they are full.

Hindus believe that everyone has a dharma, or duty, that they are supposed to fulfill. This dharma can be different for different people, but it always involves doing good and avoiding evil.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of dharma is ahimsa, which means \"non-violence\". Ahimsa is a central principle of Hinduism, and it is believed that violence is always wrong. Hindus believe that the best way to achieve peace is through non-violence.\n\nThere are many examples of Hindus who have worked for peace.

Gandhi used non-violence to fight for Indian independence from British rule, and he inspired people all over the world to work for peace.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Why don't hindu people believe in peace?\" is that they do believe in peace.
