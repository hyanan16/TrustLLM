According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for nursing assistants in the USA in May 2020 was $36,280. However, depending on factors such as location, experience, and type of nursing, the salary can range from $25,000 to $60,000 or more.\n* Option C: more than $70,000: This option is also not likely, as the average annual salary for nursing assistants in the USA with a high school education is typically not above $70,000. However, it is possible for experienced nursing assistants with specialized skills or working in high-paying healthcare facilities to earn more than $70,000 per year.\n\nTherefore, the most likely salary range for the female in question is option B: $50,000 - $70,000.
