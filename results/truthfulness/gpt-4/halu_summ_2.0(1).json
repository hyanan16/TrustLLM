De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez. In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around \u00a310million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala. However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can\u2019t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan. Corriere dello Sport reports that Inter are ready to offer \u00a322million for the Argetinian youngster.\n\n    #Summary#: David De Gea is yet to extend his contract beyond 2016. Real Madrid want the Spanish goalkeeper to replace Iker Casillas. AS claim Real will wait for contract to run down if they can't sign him. Carlo Ancelotti wants Petr Cech as a stop-gap if he has to wait until 2016.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

This is the stomach-churning moment two young girls are catapulted 100mph into the air on a slingshot ride with their terrified - and deafening - reactions caught on camera. However, when they regain consciousness they continue screaming out their final wishes. At one point Carmarie - who appears to be older - tells Kanya: 'If I die, tell my mama I love her.' But her sidekick points out if she's going, 'honey... I\u2019m [going to] be dead too!' 'Jesus mercy of killers,' she adds at another point. Ready, set, go! At the start they seem pretty calm but when the carriage tilts back and fires 300ft-high panic sets in and they let out manic screams with horrified facial expressions to match. Finally, after bungying up and down for around a minute the slingshot slows down, allowing the girls to catch their breath. To date the clip of their traumatic theme park outing has been watched more than 17 million times on Facebook.

Gangs of up to six follow wealthy shoppers in the West End before stealing their cash and belongings, according to the plain-clothes officers tasked with reducing theft in the area. In one example Metropolitan Police stopped two Chilean women wearing burkas after they had been spotted targeting rich Arab tourists in the Park Lane and Mayfair areas. Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams. A bag they were carrying contained \u20ac130,000 and \u00a320,000 as well as gold and diamond jewellery. London's busy shopping areas prove a big draw for gangs of pickpockets from around the world including Romania, Algeria and Bulgaria, reports Andy Jones on\u00a0Vice. But DC Darren Bond, whose team monitors the Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street areas, explained to the the website that Chilean pickpockets 'don't mess about'. He is quoted as saying: 'They are intelligence-led \u2013 they don't go after anyone but wealthy tourists \u2013 and operate in mixed teams of three to six, often middle-aged. 'They will look like a nice family or group of businessmen to fit in. It allows them to walk through hotels unchallenged, sit down and have breakfast, then walk out with bags, laptops, etc. They are so hard to trace.' Plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like Oxford Street, pictured. He said many arrive in Britain on a six-month VISA before heading off on a 'European tour' and police are constantly monitoring CCTV to keep tabs on  gangs and their recruits. Organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in London before flying to the likes of\u00a0Madrid, Barcelona and Milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection. DC Bond, whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year, told Vice that 'anecdotally' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were Romanians or Bulgarians, ten per cent Algerians and five per cent Chileans with the rest UK-based. 'Big city theft is now organised, international crime with bosses and a hierarchy,' he added.\n\n    #Summary#: Gangs of South Americans target shoppers in West End, police have said.

Twelve jurors and twelve alternates are on the list. The group includes 19 women and five men. It's almost entirely white and mostly middle-aged. It's a key step in the case, and it's been a long time coming. Jury selection started in January with 9,000 potential jurors. But the legal wrangling is the case is just revving up. Holmes' defense attorneys asked for a change of venue after the jury was seated Tuesday. The judge denied their request, noting that a jury had already been seated. Opening statements in the trial are scheduled to begin on April 27. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others when he allegedly opened fire inside a packed theater during the midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" on July 20, 2012. The one-time neuroscience doctoral student faces 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Now 27, he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. Wearing a gray dress shirt and tan slacks, Holmes sat quietly in court on Tuesday, looking relaxed and leaning back in his chair for much of the day as lawyers made their picks from the jury pool. He looked down often, but smiled occasionally, such as when the judge made a joke about a juror needing to share his Cheetos and when the district attorney accidentally addressed a male juror as a \"Miss.\" Even though he looked calm, defense lawyer Tamara Brady started her question and answer session with jurors Tuesday by expression concerns about Holmes getting a fair and impartial trial, saying \"I'm nervous\" and \"my client is nervous.\" District Attorney George Brauchler warned jurors to brace themselves. Tuesday's court session, he said, was the lawyers' last chance to find out if there is \"any reason you shouldn't be one of the 24 to sit through the four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt reported from Centennial City. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.\n\n    #Summary#: James Holmes' trial selection is almost entirely composed of white, middle-aged women and men, with 12 jurors and 12 alternates chosen from a pool of 9,000 potential jurors.

Four in ten Britons have an average \u00a377 of this stuff lying around because they have not got around to returning it because the task is too inconvenient and lengthy, a survey shows. When asked why, 43 per cent said they could not be bothered and 39 per cent said they did not think the value warranted the effort. Four in ten Britons have an average \u00a377 of unwanted good because they have not got round to returning it. A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people. Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the cost. Doddle has introduced changing rooms to a number of its stores to make trying and returning online purchases, easier. The facilities allow customers to collect, try and return, online unsuitable items. Chief executive Tim Robinson said: 'Customers have become so frustrated with the processes for returning online purchases that they would rather forgo the cash from the refund, to skip the lengthy and inconvenient queues associated with the task. 'But it doesn't have to be this way. We launched Doddle so that customers can collect and return online purchases in less than two minutes. It's Doddle's mission to redefine online shopping by making collecting and returning parcels easy - and save customers' time and money.'\n\n    #Summary#: Britons are choosing not to return their unwanted online shopping items, which are worth over \u00a31.5 billion. Customers are more frustrated with returning online purchases than losing the cost of the item. The research indicates that 43 percent of Britons simply can't be bothered with returning the items, while 39 percent say that the value isn't worth the return effort. Returning online purchases takes nearly half an hour each time, which is too much of a time commitment for busy people. According to the survey, women's dresses, shoes, and trousers are the most commonly unreturned items. Doddle has introduced changing rooms in its stores, making it easier to try on and return online purchases.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Cahill has won four cups with the Stamford Bridge outfit since joining in January 2012, including the Champions League, but the England defender believes league glory would be his most testing achievement yet. 'What I\u2019ve won already at Chelsea has been fantastic but we all know in cups, you play the game and don\u2019t see the next one for a month or so,' Cahill said in an interview with Soccer Saturday. Gary Cahill is yet to win the Premier League with Chelsea since joining the club in January 2012. Cahill (centre) hoists the Champions League trophy aloft after Chelsea's 2012 victory. Cahill spoke of the difference in challenging for the Premier League compared to cup competitions. 'You prepare differently. With the Premier League you\u2019re coming day-to-day, working hard a whole season, all the way through, keeping fit and doing everything you possibly can do. 'In terms of that, the reward is massive and when it is in touching distance of you, for me personally it would be amazing.' Cahill believes Chelsea were taught some important lessons last season, when they finished third, which has caused them to develop a more clinical touch to their performances. Three defeats from March 15 - April 19 in the league last year derailed any title hopes. Losses to Aston Villa and Crystal Palace on their travels were compounded when Sunderland inflicted Jose Mourinho's first home Premier league defeat upon him in 78 games. Cahill believes that Jose Mourinho's side learnt some difficult lessons during last season in the league. Cahill (right) will be back in action when Chelsea host Manchester United on Saturday in the league. 'We are more ruthless, I think we learnt a lot from last season in terms of games that people expected us to perform better in or win,' Cahill said. 'We lost a good few points last year against teams we should be beating and I think that stuck in our heads.' Chelsea can move three points nearer to their fourth Premier League trophy with three points against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.\n\n    #Summary#: Gary Cahill has won four cup competitions since joining Chelsea. The defender could win the league for the first time this season. Cahill believes league glory would be his toughest achievement yet.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Simcock said: \u2018Terror has had a trouble-free preparation and done well physically over the winter, her recent work has been solid. She is not a bad filly \u2013 she would have to be good to finish fourth in the Cheveley Park on only her second start \u2013 and she has done nothing wrong. \u2018Although she is quite clean-winded it is difficult to know where you stand fitness-wise until you get her into a race scenario. Trainer Richard Hannon is represented by Osaila and Marsh Hawk in the Nell Gwyn at Newmarket. \u2018She might prefer a bit of dig in the ground but she has already proved that she handles fast ground, and I don\u2019t think that this step up to seven furlongs will be a problem for her.\u2019 Other Nell Gwyn entries include two fillies from the Richard Hannon \u2013 Osaila, winner of the Group Three Princess Margaret Stakes winner, and Marsh Hawk, who has not run since finishing fourth in the Group One Dubai Fillies\u2019 Mile in October.

Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape, felonious assault and gross sexual imposition. He remains jailed with no bond, and court records listed no attorney for him. Allen is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls since September and fondling a third girl. Remanded:\u00a0Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape, felonious assault and gross sexual imposition. He is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls  and fondling a third girl. The assault charges allege he raped the girls while knowing he was HIV-positive and had consensual sex with a woman without telling her he has the virus that causes AIDS. Prosecutors say Allen could face a life sentence if he is convicted of having sex with a child under 13. The case marks the first time that the Franklin County prosecutor\u2019s office has charged an adult with molesting children while knowing that he carries the virus that causes AIDS. 'I was outraged when I saw that police report,' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O\u2019Brien told The Columbus Dispatch. O\u2019Brien said Allen had access to the two 12-year-old girls because his girlfriend is related to one of the children and the other sometimes spent the night with them. The assaults took place between September 1 and March 22, according to the indictment. Allen has been in the Franklin County jail since his arrest on March 25. His bail was set at $1 million. O'Brien says he is unaware of the health status of the victims in this case, whether or not any of them contracted HIV through Allen.\n\n    #Summary#: A man in Ohio has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple young girls and knowingly transmitting HIV. Keith Anthony Allen, 27, pleaded not guilty to 19 charges including rape and gross sexual imposition. He has been linked to the sexual assault of two 12-year-old girls and forcible touching of another. One of the girls is reported to be pregnant. Relatives of the victims apparently have no idea how the accused had access to them. The case is the first of its kind in Franklin County, marking the first time that the prosecutor has pursued charges against a person accused of deliberately spreading the disease while performing sexual assaults.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as \"Young Lioness\" and \"Fatayat Al Khilafah.\" One Twitter message said, \"If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs].\" Another said, \"When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding.\" The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. \"The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet.\"\n\n    #Summary#: The FBI cites social media messages sent by Keonna Thomas, 30.

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\u00a0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased. Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches. Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\n\n    #Summary#: Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk. U.S consumer advisory group says minimum space must be stipulated. Safety tests conducted on planes with more leg room than airlines offer.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The 21-year-old, who has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season, has been tipped to join one of Europe's big boys after impressing in the Eredivisie. And Brands has reiterated that Depay is likely to leave but must 'make the choice' over his next destination. Manchester United target Memphis Depay looks set to leave PSV during the summer transfer window. 21-year-old Depay celebrates winning the Dutch Eredivisie with PSV manager Phillip Cocu. Dutch international Depay has scored 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season. Brands told reporters: 'There is serious interest [in Depay] from big clubs. 'If it comes to a deal, he must make the choice. Then it's up to us to come out with such a club.' Earlier this week, the PSV chief revealed that the chances of Depay leaving are 'very high'. Speaking\u00a0to ANP, he said: 'The chances are very high that he leaves. If you see what clubs are enquiring about him, they really are the best in Europe. A 4-1 victory against sc Heerenveen earned PSV  their 22nd Eredivisie title on Saturday night. 'When I talk for PSV I would say he is not ready and should continue here for another year. But I am realistic and if I worked at a big European club, I\u2019d buy him without question. 'With a heavy heart [we would let him go], because a great player and a great guy leaves. But we are also proud that a boy from the academy is going to make such a step.' Tottenham, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain\u00a0are also among the contenders to sign Depay. Depay worked under Man United boss Louis van Gaal during Holland's successful 2014 World Cup campaign.\n\n    #Summary#: Manchester United may not be able to sign Memphis Depay as Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham are also interested in him. The 21-year-old Dutch player may have a tough decision to make as he ponders who he will play for next season.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and malicious destruction of property. She was discovered at the Court Street property in Edgartown by owner Mark Conklin on April 17. Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and the malicious destruction of property after she was arrested on April 17. Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home. According to the police report, Conklin found Filkins sitting in his living room of the property estimated to be worth $800,000. When he confronted her she claimed that she owned the house. She then fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck when Conklin called the police at about 8 a.m. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket, reports The Boston Globe. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away. According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, two framed posters, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown police department. 'If in fact you did purchase something you are a victim as well and EPD will assist you in seeking restitution via the court prosecution of this case,' the police department said on Facebook. Anyone with information can also contact the police department at 508-627-4343. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home - including a lamp and a painting - to return them.\n\n    #Summary#: Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and the malicious destruction of property.

Commissioner-General Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. \"The visit is prompted by UNRWA's deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children,\" agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN's Paula Newton.  \"Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict.\" Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.  There have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care. \"We will not abandon hope,\" Gunness said.  \"We will not submit to pessimism, because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of Yarmouk.  ... We cannot abandon the people of Yarmouk, and we will not, hence this mission.\"\n\n    #Summary#: The UN Relief Agency has expressed its concern for the safety and welfare of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians in the Yarmouk refugee camp. The commissioner plans to visit the site and assess the situation while offering possible solutions to alleviate the suffering of the people. The area is under the control of militant groups and civilian life is threatened by the conflict. The Syrian government has also been accused of dropping bombs on the camp. The camp, which accommodates people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict, has had a significant decrease in population due to the ongoing conflict. However, the UN agency remains hopeful that they can still offer assistance to the people in the camp.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Sure, he can shred it on \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" and \"Dr. Feelgood,\" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it \"disgraceful.\" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?\n\n    #Summary#: Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition.

Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy\u2019s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday. Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional. McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season. Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; \u2018Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony\u2019s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.\u2019 Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy\u2019s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998. Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it. Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash. He told Racemail: \u2018I have a kind invitation from the chairman to attend any home game before the end of the season.\u2019\n\n    #Summary#: Ian Wright, the former Arsenal striker and current television pundit, has been named as the host for the annual Sandown celebrity jockeys trophy event. During the event, the legendary jockey AP McCoy will be awarded the prestigious champion jockeys trophy. McCoy, who is a known admirer of Arsenal, will receive the trophy from Wright before the former player presents his BBC5Live radio phone-in.

The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski\u2019s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger\u2019s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season. The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January. \u2018When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,\u2019 he told Sportsmail. \u2018I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well. I had a great two and a half years; I scored a lot of goals there and had a lot of assists. \u2018The first six months of the season were not easy, that\u2019s why I changed clubs. But now I\u2019m ready.\u2019 Arsenal made it to back-to-back FA Cup finals over the weekend thanks to an extra-time win over Reading and Podolski tweeted his congratulations to his parent club, although he admitted he hadn\u2019t seen the action. The forward was busy preparing for the derby with Inter against rivals Milan, but he was left on the bench by Roberto Mancini for the second game running as the sides played out a 0-0 stalemate. Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan. Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he\u2019s getting on the pitch. \u2018It\u2019s not a problem for me. I\u2019ve been in this business of playing football long enough,\u2019 he said. \u2018Of course I want to play every game but it\u2019s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. \u2018I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it\u2019s for these types of matches you play football. \u2018I\u2019m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.\u2019 Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October.\n\n    #Summary#: Lukas Podolski left Arsenal for Inter Milan on a loan deal in January.

Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named. \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A. Fenn (history); \"The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe\" by David I. Kertzer (biography/autobiography); \"Anthracite Fields\" by Julia Wolfe (music); and \"Digest\" by Gregory Pardlo (poetry).

And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago. In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote.\n\n    #Summary#: Obama promised Armenian-Americans he would call the atrocity genocide during the 2008 campaign. The White House views Turkey as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Pope Francis, actor George Clooney, and even the Kardashians have taken the moral position, calling it the Armenian genocide.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs \u2013 a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall \u2013 take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky\u2019s ear as if whispering something \u2013 Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky. The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky\u2019s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead. All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony. Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs \u2013 who continue to wag their tails \u2013 showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise. Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: \u2018Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.\u2019 And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.\n\n    #Summary#: Three dogs from North Carolina put on a concert for their owner that left the audience howling for more. The Husky named Sky led the performance with its enchanting melody, while the two Springer Spaniels provided backup vocals. The trio left their tails wagging with the happy ending of a standing ovation.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Hingis was persuaded to play her first tour-level singles for nearly eight years because of injuries in the Switzerland team for the World Group playoff encounter against Poland. The 34-year-old brought back memories of her heyday in a thrilling 48-minute first set before capitulating 6-4 6-0 to world number nine Radwanska after 76 enjoyable minutes. Martina Hingis fought courageously but could not prevent defeat on her first return to singles since 2007. The former World No 1 was defeated 6-4, 6-0 by\u00a0Agnieszka Radwanska (right) in the Fed Cup. Hingis was persuaded to play because of injuries in the team and to secure a spot on the Olympic team. Australian Open  (1997, 1998, 1999) Wimbledon (1997) US Open\u00a0(1997) French Open runner-up\u00a0(1997, 1999) Total career singles titles:\u00a043. Total career doubles titles:\u00a044. Career prize money: $20,974,066. Smiling a lot and clearly enjoying the experience of being back in the spotlight against a player with a similarly attractive style, Hingis played some exhilarating tennis early on but her effort eventually took its toll. Half a step slower in the second set, she could only win 11 points as Radwanska upped her game to give Poland a 1-0 lead in the tie. What was most eye-catching was the way Hingis fought in the opening set, twice coming back from a break down to level the scores until the pressure exerted by Radwanska finally told. Hingis, who only plays doubles on tour those days, was making a Fed Cup return for the first time since the 1998 final because she has to play in the competition to qualify for next year's Olympics. Hingis lines up with team-mates including (L-R) Romina Oprandi, Victorija Golubic and Timea Bacsinszky. Hingis, posing with the US Open trophy in 1997, won five grand slam singles titles before her 18th birthday.\n\n    #Summary#: Switzerland are facing Poland in the Fed Cup World Group play offs. Martina Hingis lost 6-4, 6-0 to world No 9 Agnieszka Radwanska.

The Reds go into their FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn on Wednesday night off the back of damaging league losses at home to Manchester United in March followed by a 4-1 thumping at the hands of Arsenal on Saturday. Defeat at the Emirates means fifth-placed Liverpool trail fourth spot, currently occupied by Manchester City, by seven points with seven games remaining. Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho (left) says winning the FA Cup would rescue their season. Coutinho (right) started Liverpool's 4-1 thumping at top four rivals Arsenal on Saturday afternoon. Fifth-placed Liverpool (centre) are seven points adrift of fourth with seven games left in the Premier League. After the match, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four. And while Coutinho refuses to give up hope of qualifying for Europe's elite club competition for a second consecutive season, he does admit that ending the campaign with silverware would be some consolation if that was the case. 'Winning the [FA] cup would save our season. It is very important for us to have that as an objective,'\u00a0Coutinho told the club's official website. 'We have to pick ourselves up after what happened against Arsenal to get the results that we need. We want to be in the Champions League. That is our primary objective. We have seven games left and we have to see what happens.' 'Arsenal played very well, as they always do, and we did not do the things we have to do to win, the things we have done in previous games, like pressing the ball well. 'That was the difference between the two sides. It was a very difficult game but we have to pick our heads up and keep believing. We have to keep going. We have more games to come and lots of things can still happen.' After the match, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four. Rodgers (centre) is  preparing his side for their FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn on Wednesday night.\n\n    #Summary#: Philippe Coutinho hopes for a top-four finish and a FA Cup victory, with Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers conceding defeat in their quest for the Premier League's top four.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury. It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries. Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.\n\n    #Summary#: Leeds United travel to Charlton Athletic on Saturday in the Championship. Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro, Marco Silvestri Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani have withdrawn from squad.

Rob MacFarlane captured photos of the raccoon on his crane\u00a0after it climbed about\u00a0213 meters up. MacFarlane shared his first picture of 'Little Mac' on social media on Thursday morning after the crapping critter presumably made the climb over the course of the night. Rob\u00a0MacFarlane shared the picture of the brave raccoon, 'Little Mac', on social media on Thursday morning. The little critter climbed almost 700 feet up\u00a0MacFarlane's tower crane in Toronto before being photographed. He wrote: 'This critter climbed over 700' to crap on my machine deck.' In the shot, Mac can been see holding on to the ladder for dear life with its eyes staring wide. According to MacFarlane, the animal slowly climbed to the ground without being hurt and 'found somewhere else to sleep all day', the\u00a0Toronto Star reported. MacFarlane\u00a0hasn't documented prior appearances by raccoons, but he does often post photos from his crane. He said: 'They are the tortoise in the story. 'Not so fast, but efficient.

'I don't look at a man who's expert in one area as a specialist,' he told Esquire. 'I look at him as a rookie in ten other areas. If you can box, what happens if I grab hold of your legs?

The fast food giant has caused fury after installing metal studs outside its branch in Leeds city centre, which critics say are there to stop people  sleeping rough. McDonald's has defended the use of the spikes, claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour, not target the homeless. Uproar:\u00a0A petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this Leeds McDonald's and 70,000 have backed the campaign. But critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches. Isobella DeMartino set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe. Row: Critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but McDonald's say it is only about anti-social behaviour. 'Anti-homeless spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day,' she said. 'Spikes have been installed, presumably to prevent people sleeping there. 'The fact that the spikes exist shows how little people care about homeless people.' She added: 'Every time I'm in Leeds I see many ignore homeless people, not even bothering to smile at them let alone try to help them or give charity. I cannot imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless. 'They deserve our attention and care, this issue cannot be ignored.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's said: 'The studs in question are not an 'anti- homeless' measure, as has been suggested. 'They have been in place for around two years and were introduced Following discussions with the police, in response to issues we were experiencing with antisocial behaviour. 'We welcome all customers through our doors and it is inaccurate to suggest a measure taken in response to tackling antisocial behaviour, is an attempt to deter homeless people.'\n\n    #Summary#: McDonald's has caused outrage after intentionally targeting the homeless with the installation of metal studs outside their Leeds branch, according to a petition signed by over 70,000 people worldwide. Isobella DeMartino, who set up the petition, claims that this is just an example of how little people care about homeless people. Despite backlash, McDonald's maintains that the spikes were installed to prevent anti-social behavior and are not aimed at the homeless.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Walcott, pictured arriving at Turf Moor on Saturday, has struggled for playing time so far this season. The England winger has attracted interest from Premier League duo Manchester City and Liverpool.

Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club\u00a0president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer. Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory. 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer.

Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors.

'It was a thing what was always in our minds. It was going through the team. Everyone knew how important this game was, not only because it's a rat race in the last games, but also because of the history of the last four games,' he said. 'Wayne Rooney mentioned that in the dressing room before the game to all the players and it is something that you have in mind when you go on to the pitch. You saw how everyone was fighting for each other. Daley Blind played his part in Manchester United's 4-2 derby win over City on Sunday. Wayne Rooney's team talk inspired United to end a run of four defeats by their local rivals. 'Maybe after the first five minutes we were a bit like, 'What is happening here?' but after that we picked it up again and we did very well. And with the crowd behind us, it was amazing.' The Holland international also warned that Manchester United need to focus on the end of this season rather than thinking about challenging for the title next year. The 25-year-old Dutchman, who has played a significant role in United's run of six consecutive wins, accepted rivals would have taken note of the 4-2 derby win. He insisted, however, that although United could win the title next year, they had to focus on securing a Champions League place - starting against Chelsea on Saturday. City captain Vincent Kompany was fortunate not to be sent off for a reckless challenge on Blind. Blind and Ashley Young celebrate after coming back from behind against their 'noisy neighbours' Blind said: 'I think Manchester United is always a club that is fighting for the title. 'Of course other teams are watching us, but we have to watch ourselves this season, our own games, focus on that and then we will see where it ends. 'We don't have to watch for Chelsea. We have to watch for our own games, we have to look at ourselves. Every game is a final to the end and we have to believe in ourselves.'

The Portuguese was booked after being brought down by Rayo defender Antonio Amaya inside the box, incurring a one-game suspension in the process. But Ronaldo is now free to start at the Bernabeu after La Liga's appeals committee decided that he had been unfairly punished at the Estadio de Vallecas. Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned after he was chopped down by Antonio Amaya. The Real Madrid star was set to miss Saturday's game with Eibar but his yellow card has now been rescinded. Ronaldo was furious after being booked during Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will miss Saturday's game after picking up bookings against Rayo but Real immediately decided to appeal the yellow card for their star forward. Speaking after the game, Carlo Ancelotti said: 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' That appeal has now been successful and Ronaldo - who netted his 300th goal for the club in Wednesday's win - will be part of Los Blancos' starting XI against Eibar. Real currently sit second in the table but they will be looking to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who face a tough trip to fifth-placed Sevilla on Saturday evening. Ronaldo celebrates a friend's birthday on Thursday night along with Real Madrid team-mate Pepe (right) Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti will be able to call on Ronaldo against Eibar on Saturday.\n\n    #Summary#: Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo will start against Eibar on Saturday despite his violent conduct in Wednesday's match against Rayo Vallecano. Ronaldo was foolishly carded after deliberately tripping Antonio Amaya and was set to miss Saturday's game. After appeal, the star has been cleared to play. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was happy with the decision saying \"I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty.

Wenger was coming under severe pressure, so I understand where it\u2019s coming from but I would be surprised if there was a change this summer.

The youngster has a look of pure concentration as she balances the three bowls which appear to be ceramic on her head. She carefully spins around to the music, in  an adorable attempt at what appears to be a traditional female dance performed by the Uyghur people in northwestern China. The toddler may have been performing the traditional dance of the\u00a0Uyghur -\u00a0a Turkic people originally from Central Asia which have a large population in the Xinjiang  Autonomous Region\u00a0in northwestern China. The dance is also very similar to the Mongolian\u00a0Bowl Dance, a folk dance which\u00a0is performed by female dancers across Asia. Linked to hospitality, the\u00a0feminine\u00a0Zhongwan is performed by women who balance several bowls on their head and then dance with incredible skill and grace. Mongolian dances are closely connected with song or story. Men's dances feature masculine activities including the horse and sword dance, the hawk dance, and the roughrider dance. Other female folk dances such as the Chopsticks Dance (Kuaizi) or Milking Dance (Jinai).\n\n    #Summary#: This cute toddler's talented balancing skills have made her an internet hit. Tiny dancer happily spins around to music with three bowls on her head. The Chinese girl is thought to be\u00a0practising\u00a0a traditional female folk dance.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Hollywood legend, 71, who has been a long-time supporter of the Democratic Party, said if the former Secretary of State is voted into the White House there will be 'no surprises'. In an interview with the Daily Beast, the Goodfellas star said she had paid her dues, adding: 'It\u2019s that simple. And she\u2019s a woman, which is very important because her take on things may be what we need right now.' Robert De Niro, 71, (pictured with Hillary Clinton at a New York benefit in 2013), said if the former Secretary of State is voted into the White House there will be 'no surprises' He was joined by American producer and Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Jane Rosenthal. She also gave her backing to the ex-First Lady, saying: 'She\u2019s smart, has run things before, and knows how government works and how to get things done. 'She\u2019s watched it from the sidelines, and the frontlines.' De Niro joined Clinton last December was they were both honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights annual gala. His political punditry however is not something new. In 2006, while promoting The Good Shepherd, he appeared on Hardball opposite Matt Damon at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Host Chris Matthews asked De Niro who he would like to be president in the future. The veteran actor replied: 'Well, I think of two people: Hillary Clinton and Obama.' While continuing to build his stellar film career, he has also become a donor for the Democratic party. The Goodfellas star says Cliton has 'paid her dues' and insisted the Democrat has 'earned the right to be head of this country' In 2012, he hosted a $25,000-a-head dinner at the White House with Michelle Obama to raise funds for Barack Obama's re-election effort. However he caused controversy when he said it was 'too soon' for a white First Lady. Speaking at a dinner in the Greenwich Hotel, which he owns, De Niro said: 'Callista Gingrich. Karen Santorum. Ann Romney. Now do you really think our country is ready for a white first lady?' A guest at the event, which was held in the hotel's Locanda Verde restaurant, yelled, 'No!', to which De Niro added: 'Too soon, right?' Michelle Obama said the remarks were inappropriate.\n\n    #Summary#: Actor Robert De Niro has caused controversy by suggesting that Hillary Clinton should not be president.

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.\n\n    #Summary#: Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review. School officials identified student during investigation and the person admitted to hanging the noose, Duke says. The noose, made of rope, was discovered on campus about 2 a.m.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

A scan on Monday revealed Naughton suffered ligament damage and the right-back will face a six-week lay-off. David Meyler (left) lunges in high on Kyle Naughton and was sent off the poor challenge on Saturday. The full back writhes in pain following the incident and faces a six-week lay off with ankle ligament damage. A club statement said: \u2018An initial scan on Saturday ruled out a fracture, but a follow up scan last night confirmed ligament damage that will keep the January signing from Spurs out for around six weeks. \u2018With just seven league games left, it\u2019s a blow for Naughton and the Swans with the right-back continuing to impress with every appearance.\u2019 Angel Rangel will return to the side to face Everton on Saturday.

Instead of being horrified by the bizarre discovery, Elliot reportedly remained calm and even posed for photos with her treasure afterwards. Scroll down for video. Not what I ordered: Toni Elliot, 53, (right) found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on\u00a0at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee. As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told\u00a0WSMV News:\u00a0'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.' Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties.

The Tory MP who defected to Ukip to trigger the Rochester and Strood by-election is on course to lose the seat at the General Election. According to the latest secret polling bombshell to hit Nigel Farage\u2019s party, Mark Reckless, who became Ukip\u2019s second MP last November, faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority on May 7. The disclosure comes after Ukip was thrown into turmoil by last week\u2019s leak to The Mail on Sunday of a survey showing Mr Farage trailing the Tories in his target seat of Thanet South. The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November\u2019s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes. As with the Thanet South poll, the party has decided against publicising the figures in case supporters are demoralised. A senior Ukip source said: \u2018It is not looking easy for Mark, but we are hopeful the figures are misleading.\u2019 However, another source added: \u2018We aren\u2019t that bothered because Reckless isn\u2019t particularly popular.\u2019 Some analysts think Ukip could be left with just one MP \u2013 Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in a byelection with a 12,000 majority.

The Dutchman explained  he had been imploring the Spanish midfielder to control the ball before shooting in order to demonstrate a greater level of composure. And Van Gaal's emotions got the better of him when the players came in at half-time with a 1-0 advantage thanks to Herrera's 43rd minute strike. Ander Herrera (left) puts Manchester United ahead against Aston Villa with a goal in the 43rd minute. Herrea's (right) goal displayed the first touch that Louis van Gaal was eager to see from him. Van Gaal admitted that he was so pleased with Herrera's opening goal, he kissed him at the interval. 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot. 'But then I came to him after the second-half and he said 'without control I can do it also!' United strengthened their place among the top-four of the Premier League by emerging 3-1 winners against Tim Sherwood's side at Old Trafford on Saturday, with Herrera at the double.

People walking along Somerton Beach, southwest of Adelaide, found a deceased fully-clothed man aged about 45 lying on the shore on December 1, 1948. A post-mortem determined that the man had died of poisoning but police and coronial investigations were unable to identify the body due to several factors including that the poison used to kill him was undetectable. The mystery of a dead man's body washed up on a beach 67 years ago may be solved thanks to the technological advances in DNA testing. The Persian phrase 'ended' was scrawled on the scrap of paper and the discovery of a secret code and a woman's telephone number in the book where the paper came from. Even a handwritten note found hidden in the pocket of a man's trousers did not provide any clues to the identity of the body - in fact it left experts even more puzzled. The Persian phrase 'ended' was scrawled on the scrap of paper and the discovery of a secret code and a woman's telephone number in the book where the paper came from. Adelaide University Professor Derek Abbott said there was 'a good chance' of identifying the body if South Australian Attorney-General, John Rau, agreed to exhuming the remains, which are buried at an Adelaide cemetery. 'Even with a body of that age, I think we will be able to get something,' he told The Adelaide Advertiser. In October 2011, Mr Rau rejected an exhumation to go ahead because he said it did not exceed 'public curiosity or broad scientific interest'. 'If circumstances existed ... that would warrant my considering an exhumation it would be considered, however, those circumstances don't exist and never have,' he said. American forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick, who was in Adelaide yesterday as part of an expert panel discussing the Somerton Man, said she could take the body's DNA code and search ethnicity markers using data across 50 countries to find the man's origin. 'Yes, the man is dead and at peace, hopefully, but there also may be family looking for him,' Dr Fitzpatrick said.

The man, found fully clothed and about 45 years old, died of poisoning from an undetectable poison.

Baltimore police said rioting at a shopping mall and elsewhere Monday afternoon started amid rumors, spread on social media, of a \"purge\" led by large groups of marauding high school students. The term appears to be a reference to 2013's \"The Purge\" and its sequel, last year's \"The Purge: Anarchy,\" about a dystopian future America where on one day each year, all laws are suspended for a 12-hour period and all crimes, including murder, become temporarily legal. In the movies, set in Los Angeles, people barricade themselves in their homes at night while gangs of violent \"purgers\" roam the streets. The government markets the sanctioned mayhem as a catharsis that reduces crime on the other 364 days of the year -- when in fact it's really a means of population control, mostly against people living in poor urban neighborhoods. Both \"Purge\" movies were box-office hits and a third installment, \"The Purge: Vengeance,\" is planned for 2016. The Baltimore Sun reported that a flier circulated widely among city school students via social media touted a \"purge\" to begin Monday at 3 p.m. at Mondawmin Mall and end downtown. The flier included an image of protesters smashing the windshield of a police car in Baltimore on Saturday, the Sun said. How Baltimore police, protesters battle on Twitter. Maryland's largest city has been on edge since an African-American man, Freddie Gray, died April 19 from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody. Peaceful protests gave way to violence Saturday night and again Monday, as agitators threw bricks at police, looted stores and set fire to cars and buildings. Scattered references to #purge and #ThePurge began appearing in Twitter and Instagram posts Monday about the unrest in Baltimore.\n\n    #Summary#: Some of Baltimore's unrest may have been inspired by the \"Purge\" movies.

The Chelsea manager has been trialling a formation with Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four as the league leaders head to Loftus Road. Mourinho has stuck with the team that it is likely to mean a more advanced role for Cesc Fabregas in the 'No10' position behind Didier Drogba up front, with fellow striker Loic Remy out injured. Brazilian midfielder Oscar has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games. Eden Hazard, who Mourinho believes is the only realistic candidate to be named PFA player of the year, starts on the left. Willian will start on the right and his Brazilian team-mate Oscar may drop out of the starting line up for the clash at QPR. Chelsea are four points clear of Arsenal with two games in hand and Mourinho does not want to take any chances at Loftus Road. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic (right), in action against Stoke, is set to feature again in the heart of midfield. Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards. Ramires (left) is set to be restored to the Chelsea midfield for west London at QPR on Sunday. Oscar hasn't scored for Chelsea since the middle of January after an alarming dip in form for the Blues.\n\n    #Summary#: Chelsea's Jose Mourinho has made some changes to his midfield ahead of the match against Arsenal this weekend. Mourinho has experimented with a new formation featuring Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four. Didier Drogba will play up front with Cesc Fabregas as the 'No10', while Brazilian midfielder Oscar and Chelsea's PFA player of the year Eden Hazard will start on the wings.

Jia Binhui, 25, cannot afford hospital treatment and hopes his alternative treatment will fight the deadly disease. He claims experts advised him that temperatures higher than 42 degrees Celsius can kill the cancerous cells in his body, according to the People's Daily Online. Brave:\u00a0Jia Binhui, who cannot afford hospital treatment, hopes his home-made alternative treatment will fight the deadly disease. He built a human barbecue in his garden in Yunlong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, which he lies on above a fire below, like a spit roast. Jia, who was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2013, has had a bone marrow transplant, costing \u00a355,000, which was funded by well-wishers. Coming from a family of poor farm workers, further hospital treatments have used up his remaining funds. Fire starter:\u00a0Jia Binhui collects sawdust, twigs and sticks to set a fire that he can lie above. Contraption: Jia lies on top of the wooden poles once the fire (right) has died down. He hopes temperatures above 42C will cure his cancer. Desperate bid: He hopes the scorching coals will cure his leukaemia cells after running out of money for hospital treatment. Jia wrote on his Weibo account: 'They say experts believe a temperature higher than 42 degrees Celsius can kill cancer cells, so I set up a contraption in my backyard to try. 'Let's see if it works.' Last month, Jia married his long-term girlfriend Liu Yuan and said he refuses to be defeated by the disease. The fire is made using sawdust, twigs and branches which he then lights and leaves to burn for several minutes for it to get hot enough. Determined:\u00a0Jia married his long-term girlfriend Liu Yuan last month and refuses to give up despite not being able to fund cancer treatment. Home hospital: Jia has built the device at his home in\u00a0southwest China's Yunnan Province in the hope it will cure his cancer. He then lies on top of the wooden poles for as long as he can physically take the roasting temperature. 'I've been told that it also works in water. But it's nearly impossible to keep water constantly at 42 degrees Celsius, so I'm using this method instead' he said. Jai added that he will continue using this unorthodox treatment before returning to the hospital to see if his condition has improved.\n\n    #Summary#: Jia Binhui cannot afford hospital treatment for deadly disease.

The 65-year old from Halliwell, Bolton was just about to put his meal in the cooker when he caught sight of the black and white California king hiding inside. Atherton scooped up the reptile and placed it in a plastic food recycling box before alerting the police. Shocked: David Atherton, 65, went to put his meal in the oven when he discovered a three-foot California king snake (pictured) hiding inside. RSPCA officers came to collect the snake the same evening and it has been given a temporary home with a local conservationist since. Atherton's 73-year-old sister Margaret - who has a phobia of snakes - became severely distressed when she heard about the incident and needed to go to hospital with heart problems. He said: 'Her phobia is so bad she cannot even look at a snake on TV, let alone see one in real life. 'I would not like to hazard a guess as to what would have happened if she had been the one to open the oven and see it. It could have been much worse.' He added: 'When I pulled down the oven door I saw the snake hanging down from the side and and at first I thought it was part of a food packet, but then I realised what it was. 'There is a small gap between the oven and the fitted cupboards, which must be what it came through. 'You could not make it up and I must confess it is not something that happens every day.' Experts said the banded California king snakes can grow up to 6ft in length and were commonly kept as pets. Slither: Atherton - whose sister has an extreme phobia of snakes - scooped up the reptile and placed it inside a plastic food recycling box (pictured) RSPCA inspector Melissa Furey said it is common to see an influx of snakes coming out in April as the weather gets warmer.

'Pet owners need to be responsible and make sure they have the correct equipment - vivariums with locks - because snakes are really good escape artists and can slip through the smallest of gaps.'\n\n    #Summary#: A mysterious three-foot snake was discovered hiding inside a toaster by a startled pensioner from Bolton. David Atherton, 65, was trying to make toast when he found the reptile lurking inside. Thankfully, he managed to catch it and kept it in a shoebox until animal control officers arrived. Mr. Atherton's sister, who has a terrible phobia of snakes, was unfortunately paralyzed with fear on seeing it and had to be rushed to the hospital. The local authorities are now investigating how the snake managed to get inside the toaster and evade detection.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining. Lazio did mount a late rally at the Juventus Stadium but the dismissal of midfielder Danilo Cataldi for a heavy tackle on Tevez ended their challenge. Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for Juventus after 17 minutes as they beat Lazio on Saturday. Tevez jumps for joy after firing Juventus ahead with his 26th goal of the season. The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning. Samp are now level on Napoli with 50 points while 18th-placed Cesena are six points shy of Atalanta and safety with seven games still to play.\n\n    #Summary#: Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 on Saturday to move 15 points clear in Serie A.

Filing an official complaint to Russia, the State Department alleges a U.S. RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft was flying near the Baltic Sea in international airspace when a Russian SU-27 Flanker cut into its path. Pentagon officials have slammed the move as 'unprofessional' and 'unsafe'. A Russian jet 'aggressively' intercepted a U.S. RC-135U plane (pictured) over Poland, the Pentagon claims. Spokesman Mark Wright told CNN the Russian jet performed 'aggressive maneuvers' at high speed in close proximity to the plane. He added that the State Department will consequently be filing a complaint to Russia 'through diplomatic channels'. Russia has rubbished claims it was a deliberate and aggressive interception. State news agency Sputnik reported that the jet was circling the plane to determine its tail number, as its transponder was switched off. The\u00a0Russian SU-27 Flanker 'aggressively' cut into the American plane's path, the spokesman stated. The Pentagon and the U.S. European Command have dismissed the account. The incident occurred almost exactly a year after Pentagon officials accused a Russian fighter jet of purposely flying 100 feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane over\u00a0the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan.

The pair's careers in England are drawing to a close with Gerrard and Lampard leaving for America at the end of the season. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are to be honoured by the PFA before they leave the Premier League. Gerrard and Lampard have been stalwarts of the English game for the past decade and a half. Both players have now retired from international football, after winning a combined 220 caps for their country. Liverpool captain Gerrard is joining LA Galaxy, while Lampard will meet up with new MLS franchise New York City FC. And the PFA will acknowledge their exceptional careers on the same night they reveal the player and young player of the season. The pair have won 19 major trophies between them - including two Champions League and two UEFA Cup/Europa League victories. A rarity in modern day football, Gerrard and Lampard clinched those titles with one club, Liverpool and Chelsea, respectively - though the latter has also played for West Ham and Manchester City. The twosome also amassed a total of 220 England appearances, many of them playing together in central midfield. The two England midfielders, who will both play in the MLS next year, have amassed 19 major trophies. Gerrard will join LA Galaxy at the end of the season, with Lampard moving to New York City FC.\n\n    #Summary#: Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to be given special merit awards.

In recent years Villa have struggled to compete but they are a proper club. When I left Arsenal for Villa it was because I felt they shared similar traits - tradition, history and both took pride of place in their communities. Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League and in the early years of the FA Cup, the trophy was almost theirs to keep. Now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter. Aston Villa celebrate in the Wembley dressing room after beating Liverpool to reach this year's FA Cup final. Martin Keown joined Aston Villa in 1986 and made the move because of the club's rich history and tradition. Tim Sherwood has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances. But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient. Talking about getting a club \u2018back where they belong\u2019 can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic. Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O\u2019Neill there were still rumblings of discontent. When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn\u2019t when things are going badly? In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side. Making the final is a fine achievement and Sherwood and his players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club. Aston Villa celebrate winning the European Cup after beating Bayern Munich in Rotterdam 33 years ago. Manager Tim Sherwood has invigorated Aston Villa and has considerably improved the side's performances.\n\n    #Summary#: Aston Villa have a chance of FA Cup glory after reaching the final. A few months ago the Midlands club only had survival to contend with. The Aston Villa squad can write the next chapter in the club's history.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Suddenly, he's set to buy his own place and collect a nice pension. Helinski hit it big thanks to the Social Security Administration, and a big-hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy. Charles Inman could not bear to see his 62-year-old ward land back on the street, he told CNN affiliate WFTS. The shelter where the case worker works set Helinski up with a bunk and a locker. But getting him into the system was hard, because Helinski's ID and Social Security cards had been stolen. \"He needed to have an identification, but we couldn't get an identification without a birth certificate,\" Inman said. A hassle all by itself, except that Helinski was foreign born -- in Poland, as an American citizen. \"We first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that,\" said Tampa police Officer Dan McDonald, who pitched in to help Helinski. With those papers squared away, he and Inman got Helinski a driver's license and a Social Security card. Then, Helinski remembered that he used to have an account with a certain Landmark Bank. \"Then it became Bank of America,\" he said. The account was still there, and the Social Security Administration hadn't forgotten about him. It had kept paying Helinski benefits for years, and they had stacked up high. Now Helinski is thinking of buying his own four walls. And he'll have monthly benefits to live on. \"I guess I'm exhilarated, excited, you know,\" he said. McDonald said he and Inman were stunned. \"We weren't quite sure what to say.\"\n\n    #Summary#: A homeless man in Tampa, Florida suddenly became a millionaire after discovering a long-forgotten bank account.

The number of allergy sufferers is soaring and almost half of those with severe allergies live in daily fear of suffering a potentially fatal reaction. Yet many Britons are unaware of the seriousness of the condition, says the study by charity Allergy UK. Scroll down for video. The number of allergy sufferers is soaring and almost half of those with severe allergies live in daily fear of suffering a potentially fatal reaction. A poll of more than 2,000 adults to mark Allergy Awareness Week reveals that over two thirds would not know how to help if they saw someone suffering an allergic reaction. Two-thirds also don't know how to use an adrenaline pen which can save the lives of those suffering a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. The warning comes as latest figures show hospital admissions for allergies increased by 8 per cent between 2013 and 2014. More than 20,000 people a year are admitted to hospital in England for allergic reactions. A poll of more than 2,000 adults for the charity to mark the start of Allergy Awareness Week reveals that over two thirds of adults (68 per cent) would not know how to help if they saw someone suffering an allergic reaction. Around 21million Britons have some kind of allergy, ranging from hayfever to reactions to food, medication and wasp stings. Nearly all of those living with a severe allergy say their daily life is affected by the condition. There is no consensus on the reasons for the increase in allergies but explanations put forward include a combination of changing diet, genetics and improved hygiene. For example, we now live in a cleaner world, so children are no longer coming into contact with the bacteria that is needed to develop the immune system.\n\n    #Summary#: Hospital admissions for allergies rose by 8 per cent between 2013 and 2014.

In a statement on the official club website, Toulon said that 27-year-old Cooper had agreed a two-year deal and will move to France this summer. The Queensland Reds fly-half, who has won 53 caps, becomes the latest Australia international to move abroad, following players like Will Genia, James Horwill and Adam Ashley-Cooper. Quade Cooper played against England in the Autumn Internationals and will join Toulon this summer. Former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau has guided the Top 14 side to the\u00a0European Champions Cup final. He is currently injured, though, and continuing his recovery from a broken shoulder-blade that he suffered playing for the Reds earlier this month. Bernard Foley is favourite to wear the Wallabies number 10 shirt for their World Cup campaign, which starts against Fiji in Cardiff on September 23. Cooper, meanwhile, will link up with former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau, who has been instrumental in guiding the French club to this season's European Champions Cup final. Toulon are chasing an unprecedented hat-trick of European titles, and they will play Clermont Auvergne in the final at Twickenham in eight days' time. Bernard Foley is favourite to wear the Wallabies number 10 shirt for their World Cup campaign this autumn.

Crunching the numbers, a new study by Pew Charitable Trusts has revealed the exact salary you need to qualify in each state. Maryland's middle class is the highest paid in the country, with an average income of $72,483. Alaska is second with $72,237, followed by New Jersey with $70,165. The top five is completed by Hawaii and the District of Columbia, where middle class citizens are paid an average higher than $67,500. With an average income of $37,963, Mississippi's middle class is the lowest paid in the country. It is followed by Arkansas with $40,511, West Virginia with $41,253, Alabama with $42,849, and Kentucky with $43,399. New York - home to the financial capital of the United States, New York City - falls 17th in the table. The lowest paid middle class citizen in New York earns $38,246 and the highest paid takes an annual salary of $114,738. The average is $57,369. In California, 11th on the table, the average middle class income is $60,190, with a lower limit of $40,127 and an upper limit of $120,380. According to the study, published on March 19, America's middle class has shrunk significantly in the wake of the financial crisis. This colored map of the country displays the shrinking middle class across the U.S. However, whether you earn $20,000 or $250,000, you are still more likely to classify yourself as 'middle class'. Technically, Pew's researchers explain, middle class households earn between 67 and 200 per cent of the state's average income. The national average income is $52,250.\n\n    #Summary#: The majority of Americans who earn anywhere between $20k and $250k identify themselves as 'middle class', according to a new study by Pew Charitable Trusts. The study lists the exact salary needed to qualify as middle class in each state, with the top five highest paid middle class citizens residing in Maryland, Alaska, New Jersey, Hawaii, and DC, and the lowest paid in Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, and Kentucky. Interestingly, California falls 11th on the table, with an average middle class income of $60,190. With the national average income being $52,250, it's clear that making a decent living in America takes a lot more than just being middle class.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail. The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain\u2019s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to\u00a0the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims \u2018are very polite\u2019 and \u2018always friendly\u2019. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said \u2018it makes no sense\u2019 that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a \u2018huge failure\u2019 that needs to be remedied.\n\n    #Summary#: Lastres, a popular pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, has become a tourist attraction after signs warning visitors not to litter were posted by residents. Pilgrims who walk nearly 500 miles have been posing for photos with the amusing signs, which depict a squatting figure and a red circle with a line across it. Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, claimed that the signs were unnecessary as \u201cpilgrims are always friendly and very polite\u201d. The mayor of Santos, Julio Gallego, described the lack of public facilities for pilgrims as a \u201chuge failure\u201d which needs to be addressed.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Davis, 21, had lost her only career meeting with Bouchard, but was in control this time against the world No 7. Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke Bouchard's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset. Eugenie Bouchard fires down a serve during her second-round match at the Family Circle Cup. Bouchard shows her frustrations during her straight-sets defeat by Lauren Davis on Wednesday. 'I've never beaten here before, so I came out knowing I had nothing to lose,' said Davis, ranked 66th in the world. Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents. Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead. Davis hits a forehand on her way to an impressive win against the Canadian top seed. Bouchard has struggled recently, this time slumping to her fourth defeat in six matches. The match ended on Bouchard's forehand into the net, Davis waving to the cheering crowd. Bouchard said: 'As soon as it was over, definitely a bit of anger, but also kind of this confusion, slash, like quest to find what's wrong, like this kind of searching feeling that, 'OK, like I know something's off.' 'I know something's not right. So I want to find it. I was definitely a little bit slow today, overpowered. 'Usually, I'm the one dominating. So it was definitely, just, I don't know, just not good.'\n\n    #Summary#: Eugenie Bouchard's losing streak continued as she was defeated by Lauren Davis in the Family Circle Cup, leaving her quest to find the reason for her poor performance.

The Togolese's move to Spurs has proved a massive financial burden for the north London club, who pay the forward \u00a3100,000-per-week. Although, the club would still preferably receive a fee for the striker, it may prove difficult to find a potential buyer. Emmanuel Adebayor (left) could be allowed to leave the club on a free transfer in the summer. As revealed by Sportsmail on April 1, the club's chairman Daniel Levy will subsidies Adebayor's wages to ensure he leaves this summer knowing potential suitors will not meet his current \u00a35.2million-per-season salary. And to make his path out of White Hart Lane even clearer, the club are willing to grant the former Arsenal man a free transfer as an extra sweetener for prospective buyers, despite the fact he will still have a season left on his contract. Tottenham would still like to receive a fee for the striker but they just want rid of his massive wages. The 31-year-old is on the peripheries of Mauricio Pochettino's plans and is highly unlikely to be granted a route back in. Tottenham are determined to offload the striker this summer, but know they'll have to take a financial hit to do so.

The Spaniard had failed to register a single assist or goal from 19 La Liga appearances this season, prompting critics to suggest the 30-year-old was on the decline. But Iniesta capped an impressive 45 minutes in his side's Champions League quarter-final second-leg victory over PSG with a mesmeric run and pass for Neymar to score his first goal of the evening at the Camp Nou. Andres Iniesta showed there is life in the old dog yet with a majestic first-half performances versus PSG. Iniesta \u00a0provided Neymar with his first goal on the night with a trademark through-ball after 14 minutes. 'I was glad to take part in the semi-finals and it was a great night for everyone,' Inietsa told reporters. 'Am I back? I never went away. 'It was not easy at all, despite us having the 3-1 advantage. We're peaking at a great time by playing well at the end of the season. We have gone from strength to strength, which is what it should be like. 'We're in great form but we know that matches can be decided by the smallest of details. We know that our presence in the semi-finals is important, though, and it's great that we made it that far.' Barcelona's No 8 goes to celebrate with Neymar after killing off the French side in the opening half. Neymar added his second of the night to make it 30 goals for the season as Barcelona cruised past PSG. Iniesta's ability to adapt his game may yet add years to his already glittering career at the Camp Nou. Iniesta has been forced to play a deeper role this season to accommodate the triple threat of Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. And it was from his deep-lying central position that the diminutive midfielder started his slalom through the heart of Laurent Blanc's side just shy of the quarter-hour mark, before laying the ball on a plate for Neymar to score his 29th goal of the season. Iniesta was replaced by Xavi at half-time, as Barcelona went on to complete a 5-1 aggregate victory that puts them in the draw for the Champions League semi-finals for the seventh time in eight years.\n\n    #Summary#: Despite being criticized for his poor performances this season, Andres Iniesta showed his undeniable brilliance on Tuesday night against PSG with a stunning hat-trick that put Barcelona through to the Champions League semi-finals. His incredible display made it clear that he is still one of the most talented players in the world, and his adaptability on the pitch ensures that he will continue to be a key player for Barcelona in the years ahead.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger\u2019s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard\u2019s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager\u2019s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season\u2019s standout player for \u00a332million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for \u00a332million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out. Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house. Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille. That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: \u2018I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. \u2018It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.\u2019 Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday\u2019s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal\u2019s Alexis Sanchez. He said: \u2018It\u2019s very close. Let\u2019s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn\u2019t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. \u2018I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. \u2018He can turn games when it\u2019s 0-0 and when it\u2019s tight. That\u2019s always a sign of top quality.\u2019 Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote. Chelsea fans reach out to their star man during last weekend's win against Manchester United.\n\n    #Summary#: Arsenal backed out of signing Eden Hazard in the summer of 2012. Chelsea instead landed this season's standout player for \u00a332million. Arsene Wenger admits he does not have any regrets at missing out. Wenger says signing Hazard was not financially viable for Arsenal.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

A French model starring in a television film for Garnier is filmed and photographed as she 'ages' an average of five years throughout a typical working day. The Parisian public observe her appearance and proceed to judge her as older - from as young as 26 to as old as 40 - as the day progresses. At 7am the actress looks bright and bushy tailed, ready for the day ahead - studio lights capture this in the ad. But by 9.47 she looks exhausted as she prepares the family dinner and does the laundry after a day at work. The working mother-of-two is seen drying her hair first thing, dropping her two young children off at school, working out, working on a computer in the office, food shopping and more as a camera follows her every move. She is photographed at the beginning of her day and at the end - at 7am and 9.47pm - and both images\u00a0are\u00a0then judged independently by people on the street. Looking at the morning photo, strangers generally thought she looked somewhere between her late twenties or early thirties, but with the evening photo, they guessed she was in\u00a0her late thirties and forties. Researchers found she looked five years older in the evening photograph compared to the morning image based on the average ages guessed. The advert for Garnier's Miracle Sleeping Cream ends with the statement 'In only one day, fatigue can age you by five years.', followed by the answer to all your problems: 'But a miracle can change everything'. If there's a best way to sell face cream, this creation by Paris agency Publicis Conseil would surely take top prize. Probably because it can make you feel awful about yourself.

Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up \u2013 and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. \u2018I\u2019ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be. Steven Finn believes he's regained his previous best form and is ready to push for an England place. Finn admits he's 'had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months' but he's got his 'head straight' Finn smiles as he helps launch\u00a0ECB's Club Open Days on Tuesday at Brondesbury Cricket Club. \u2018My running style is something I\u2019ve had my issues with \u2013 kneeing the stumps and shortening my run-up, which is what c**ked me up, really. It\u2019s about trying to get it back to being natural. \u2018We\u2019ve got footage that I use when I\u2019ve been bowling at my best. When I was running up as a carefree 21-year-old, I just legged it into the crease. 'It was natural, and I bowled quickly, consistently. My bowling\u2019s looking pretty similar to that at the moment.\u2019 Finn\u2019s claims will be music to the selectors\u2019 ears as they begin to fret about England\u2019s fast-bowling stocks. Finn says he's been watching footage of when he was on the top of his form and is returning to that style. Finn\u2019s form return comes at a good time as England's fast bowling stocks are starting to worry selectors. The 26-year-old Finn has played only one Championship game for Middlesex this season, but insisted he felt ready to add to his 23 Test caps, the last of which he won back in 2013. \u2018I don\u2019t feel I\u2019d have done myself a disservice had I been on the West Indies trip,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the World Cup, if you take out the wickets against Australia, I was taking proper wickets \u2013 lbw, bowled, caught behind. \u2018Coming back to Middlesex and getting my head straight hasn\u2019t been the worst thing. I\u2019m gutted I\u2019m not in the West Indies, but this is the next best thing.\u2019 This summer more than 1000 cricket clubs will take part in Club Open Days, supported by Waitrose \u2013 register your club at ecb.co.uk/clubopendays.\n\n    #Summary#: Steven Finn was left out of the England squad for the West Indies tour. The Middlesex quick bowler has regained form after a tough 12 months. Finn said he's back to bowling like he was as 'a carefree 21-year-old' His last of 23 Test caps came for England back in 2013.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

McCall watched his side, which contained five English-qualified forwards in the starting pack, battle in vain before losing 13-9 to the Clermont on Saturday. Saracens\u2019 millionaire chairman Nigel Wray spent much of last week repeating his belief the cap should be scrapped in order for Saracens to compete at Europe\u2019s top table, raising expectations they could be set to land a \u2018marquee\u2019 player from outside the league whose wages would sit outside next season\u2019s \u00a35.5m cap.

Adams and other family members were at home at the time but were not aware of the break-in, in which two cars, training kit and valuable personal possessions were taken. Adams had been due to contest the women's 51kg flyweight division including a prospective final showdown against her Great Britain rival Lisa Whiteside. Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams has had to pull out of the English National Championships. Adams said in a statement: 'Nothing makes me prouder than boxing on home ground with the support I get from the nation. 'So, after much thought and discussion with England Boxing, I'm deeply regretful to have to pull out. It's not an easy time for me and my family. We would like to thank everyone for their understanding and support - the boxing team, the police and all my supporters.' Adams had been due to fight on Saturday in what would have been her first fight in England since her gold medal triumph at London 2012. Victory was likely to have taken her through to the Sunday final to face Whiteside - a former police officer - who won a world silver medal last year in Adams' injury-enforced absence. Adams (right) decided not to fight after a burglary at her home, which occurred while she was in the house. The bout at Liverpool's Echo Arena was widely seen to have been an opportunity for Adams to reassert her dominance over her rival as part of preparations for next year's Rio Olympics. England Boxing chief executive Mark Abberley said: 'The most important thing is that Nicola and her family were unharmed and our thoughts and best wishes are with them. 'We were looking forward to Nicola taking part in the first ever England Boxing Championships in which the men and women's finals are held as part of the same tournament, however it is completely understandable that Nicola does not feel in any fit state to compete and we wish her all the very best in coming to terms with this upsetting incident.'\n\n    #Summary#: Nicola Adams has suffered a severe injury and will be unable to compete in the English National Championships this weekend. The Olympic gold medallist and Great Britain rival Lisa Whiteside will have to wait until next year's Rio Olympics to face off again. Adams hopes to make a full recovery in time for the Summer Games. Meanwhile, her training kit and personal possessions, including two cars, were stolen from her Leeds home.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",
