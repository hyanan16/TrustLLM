This is highly unlikely, as Damian Lillard is a professional basketball player, not an opera performer.

A six-month-old baby died with traces of cocaine in her stomach despite her drug-user parents being reported to social services five times. Small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant, known as Mary, who died suddenly in 2013, after a lengthy stay in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby's vulnerability. According to a report, Mary's family, who lived in Liverpool, were well-known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child neglect. A school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up. Mary was the youngest child in a family of four children born to a mother aged 30 and a father aged 33. At the time of her death, her siblings were one, eight and 10. Her parents came to the attention of social care unit Careline five times between 2008 and 2012. Mary's siblings' school had already raised concerns that the two eldest children were overweight, staying off school and left to look after their baby brother while their parents stayed in bed. Mary was born 12 weeks early at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in January 2013 and was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions, including a heart murmur. She was kept in hospital for three months during which time there were 'several consecutive days' in which she had no contact with her parents. After she was discharged from hospital and into her parents' care, a number of community nurse follow-up visits were scheduled. But the nurse was unable to get access to the family despite visiting them three times in one week. A fourth visit was successful but later appointments were not kept. A day before Mary died in July 2013, a health visitor went to the home but was stopped at the door. A post-mortem revealed the presence 'at very low levels' of cocaine, tramadol and mirtazapine (an anti-depressant) in her stomach. Police also found empty beer cans, drugs and a syringe on the premises and her mother admitted to the police that she used cocaine and cannabis in the home. Because of a lack of evidence, a coroner ruled the cause of Mary\u2019s death was 'unascertained' as it was ruled the traces of drugs, which could have come from the environment or through resuscitation attempts, were not considered to have directly led to her death. A post-mortem revealed the presence of cocaine, pictured, at 'very low levels' as well as tramadol and mirtazapine, an anti depressant (file picture) The report said: 'Whilst agencies had some concerns about the older children, they generally worked to single rather than multi-agency agendas and processes. 'There was some evidence of good informal liaisons such as between the school and the education welfare officer, or the school and school nurse, but generally the level of inter-agency communication required to support a family with four children was not achieved. 'Child Mary was a vulnerable child and a discussion between health professionals may well have highlighted important information about [the mother\u2019s] history of not engaging with health services in respect of her children and the shared information may have led to further action.' But Liverpool Safeguarding Children Board, which compiled the independent report, said it was impossible to tell if the death of baby Mary \u2013 not her real name \u2013 could have been avoided. Chairman Howard Cooper said: 'Predicting the likelihood of such an outcome for a vulnerable baby is difficult to achieve with any meaningful degree of accuracy. 'It cannot be inferred that child Mary\u2019s death was preventable, but there are lessons to be learned for all the agencies involved with this family about multi-agency working.\u201d Mr Cooper said a number of recommendations had been made in the wake of the infant's death to improve working relationships between agencies tasked with supporting vulnerable children and their families. The 10 findings made by the board included an assessment that the follow-up services by Mary\u2019s hospital and community health services were \u201cineffective\u201d for a vulnerable baby in the care of parents with a \u201cvery poor history of co-operation\u201d. The panel also criticised the lack of a multi-agency system for monitoring missed medical appointments, resulting in \u201cpotentially significant\u201d signs of neglect being missed.\n\n    #Summary#: Infant, known as Mary, was also found with two other drugs in her system. She was discharged from hospital despite her parents being drug users. The family from Liverpool were already well-known to local social services.

Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot. No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago. There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left. Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community. Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years. Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot. John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook. He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society. Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space. 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.\n\n    #Summary#: Homeless people in Seattle have found a new home in the form of RVs in a floating neighborhood in the SoDo area. As many as 30 RVs are parked in one location where they are watched over by the owner. Visual journalist Anna Erickson shared her pictures of the community, who are grateful to have found a stable home.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The University of Houston said in a statement Tuesday that it was paying McConaughey speaking fees totaling $135,000 plus travel expenses, as well as a $20,250 commission to the Celebrity Talent International booking agency engaged by the university. Meanwhile, the statement says McConaughey is donating his fees to his jk livin Foundation, which the actor started to provide tools to help high school students lead active lives and make healthy choices for the future. Got $135,000: A Texas university that booked Matthew McConaughey as its May commencement speaker has broken the silence on the Texas-born actor's speaking fee. The university initially balked at revealing McConaughey's fee, citing a confidentiality agreement with the booking agency. However, the university says its business with the agency is now finished. 'The university has concluded its business with CTI and, therefore, is no longer bound by its confidentiality agreement with the agency,' the university said in a statement. It was CTI, however, that initially opposed the disclosure after the Houston Chronicle filed a FOIA request concerning the fee--which will be paid through taxes and tuition. The booking agency argued a 'reporter or someone' might create 'unfair negatives online,' the Chronicle reports. The university will also pay a 15 percent booking fee to CTI, or $20,250. The university did not divulge the fees it's paid to previous speakers, though it is not uncommon for schools to pay celebrities and other biog name speakers top dollar. According to the UH release, jk livin 'serves more than 2,000 students at 24 programs in California, Texas, Louisiana and Washington, D.C.' 'I've had the instincts to help since I was a kid,' McConaughey says. 'I was raised that way. As a kid I was pushed to go give time in my community, and it felt good. You learn as a kid.' The University of Houston is a public institution and one of Texas's largest colleges. Officials there initially balked at revealing McConaughey's salary but has since said a confidentiality agreement is no longer binding.\n\n    #Summary#: The public Texas university first balked at disclosing the actor's fee but has since caved, saying a confidentiality agreement is no longer binding.

The defense from the daughters comes nearly two months after their mother Ellen Brody\u00a0was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in the Westchester County town of Valhalla. Though the cause of the collision remains unknown, Danielle, Julia and Alexa Brody say that their mother has been criticized and that people have jumped to conclusions about what happened. Scroll down for video. Ellen Brody's (second from right) three daughters, Alexa (left), Danielle (second from left) and Julia (right) Brody, have spoken out to say that their mother is not a murderer and that it was an accident that she drove on to the tracks. Ellen Brody\u00a0was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in early February. Her car had gotten stuck between the railroad crossings and instead of reversing she drove on to the tracks. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy. 'I went on Google, and I searched my mom's name and I was just reading the comments,' Julia told NBC's Matt Lauer. 'And just the fact that people are like, 'You know, I don't even feel bad for her. How could she possibly do that?'' Julia went on to admit that she first thought that a driver had intentionally driven on to the tracks, before she knew her mother was driving. 'So I was like, \"Why? Why? Why would this woman do that?'\" When we were watching that, though, when he described the woman, I was like, \"That could've been Mommy.\" And my sisters were just like, \"Julia, no,\"' she said. According to investigators' preliminary findings,  Brody's car was in the danger zone inside railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit. Brody got ahead of the crossing gate in inching traffic, then got out of her car to examine it after the gate came down and hit the back of it, a witness has said. Nearly two months after the crash Alexa (left), Julia (center) and Danielle (right) Brody told Matt Lauer that people are still jumping to conclusions about what happened. The cause\u00a0of the collision remains unknown and Brody's daughters remain adamant that their mother never meant to hurt anyone. But then she got back in, seeming unhurried, and advanced onto the track, the witness told news outlets and investigators. The train's engineer also told investigators that he saw the Mercedes SUV moving onto the tracks. But her daughters are adamant that their mother wouldn't have meant to hurt anyone. 'I know who my mom was,' Alexa told NBC. 'I know that she would never, never intentionally hurt people.' 'A lot of times people just want to find a reason,' Danielle added. 'It's just not true. It was an accident.' And Julia put it simply: 'She's not a murderer,' she said. Julia (second from left), Danielle (center) and Alexa (right), pictured with their mother Ellen (left) and father\u00a0Alan Brody (second from right), \u00a0say when they Google their mother's name, they see that commenters have been criticizing their mother. Alexa said that her mother was her best friend and that she would think of her every time she smiled. Trains hit cars on the tracks many times a year, but such crashes rarely kill train riders. Investigators emphasized in February that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads. Investigators looked for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank. The NTSB has examined such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail. There is no barrier at the crossing between the street and the tracks where the crash occurred. MTA is considering all possible safety enhancements that would prevent deadly accidents in the future, the company's chairman said.\n\n    #Summary#: Ellen Brody, a mother-of-three was killed along with five rail passengers in February in the horrific crash in Valhalla, New York. Daughters Danielle, Julia and Alexa Brody have spoken out to say that they believe their mother drove on to the tracks by accident. The cause of the collision that killed six still remains unknown.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Here are some examples:\n\n* The summary states that Ellen Brody was killed along with five rail passengers in February, but the document mentions that six people died in the crash, including Brody.\n* The summary implies that Brody deliberately drove her SUV onto the train tracks, stating that she \"drove on to the tracks by accident,\" while the document reports that investigators have not yet determined the cause of the collision and that Brody's car entered the danger zone inside the railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit.\n* The summary quotes Julia Brody, one of Ellen Brody's daughters, as saying, \"She's not a murderer,\" implying that people have accused her mother of intentional wrongdoing. However, the document only reports that Julia Brody said her mother wouldn't have meant to hurt anyone and that her family wants to clear her name.\n\nTherefore, based on these discrepancies, I would conclude that the summary contains non-factual or hallucinated information."

Three points were all that separated Barnet from the Conference title, and two goals from Mauro Vilhete ensured Martin Allen\u2019s fourth spell in charge of the club would be his most successful. This was a potential banana skin. Lose or draw, and Bristol Rovers would have taken Barnet\u2019s place. Yet those in the South West will have to make do with the play-offs. There was to be no drama on this finale. Mauro Vilhete (right)\u00a0celebrates with Curtis Weston after opening the scoring for Barnet on Saturday. Vilhete doubled his tally in the second-half as Barnet defeated Gateshead 2-0 in the Conference clash. Barnet clinched a return to the Football League on Saturday following a two-year absence. Barnet fans invade the pitch after the final whistle as their team win promotion back to the Football League. Barnet manager Martin Allen celebrates with goalkeeper Graham Stack after securing the Conference title. BARNET:\u00a0Stack; Yiadom, Johnson, N\u2019Gala, Stephens; Weston, Togwell, Vilhete (Saville 89), Clifford; Gash, Akinde (Villa 89) Subs not used: MacDonald, Muggleton, Gambin. Goals: Vilhete (25, 49) Booked: Weston. GATESHEAD:\u00a0Bartlett; Pattinson, Curtis, Clark, Baxter; Chandler, Gillies (Shaw 57), Finnigan; Rodman (Ramshaw 46), Sainte-Luce; Rankine. Subs not used:\u00a0Dixon, Allan, Orrell. Referee:\u00a0Darren England. Attendance: 5,233. Gateshead played their part in the script to perfection, and were continually on the back foot. Allen made sure of that by being the most animated figure at the sold-out Hive. There is just something about this club that keeps attracting the man nicknamed Mad Dog back. Yet he looked ready to pull his hair out after just four minutes when John Akinde cut the ball back for Michael Gash, only for the Barnet attacker\u2019s tame shot to be cleared off the line by Jamie Chandler. Barnet were dominating, while Gateshead were simply surviving. Yet the breakthrough arrived in the 25th minute. A straightforward set-piece resulted in a free header for one of the smallest men on the pitch. Vilhete rose highest, and eased the tension. No reaction from Allen. No clenched fist. Nothing. He simply turned away, and walked back to his seat. There was still work to do. They could have made it two shortly after, when captain Curtis Weston\u2019s volley met the crossbar. It was beginning to look like Gateshead were in for a long afternoon, and so they were. The daylight arrived in the 48th minute. Michael Gash\u2019s header was instinctively kept out by Gateshead goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, but the rebound was not. Vilhete made no mistake, thumping the ball home from just three yards out. This time, Allen celebrated. Yet Gateshead wanted to remind them they were still there. A header from Carl Finnigan was denied by the out-stretched hand of goalkeeper Adam Bartlett. As good a save you would ever see, no matter which division. That was about as close Gateshead came to threatening the champions on a day that belonged to Barnet. Champions: Barnet. Play-off qualification: Bristol Rovers, Grimsby Town, Eastleigh and Forest Green Rovers. Relegated: Alfreton, Telford United, Dartford, Nuneaton. The title-winning victory ensures Allen\u2019s fourth spell in charge of the club would be his most successful. The Barnet team celebrate with the trophy after clinching promotion on Saturday.\n\n    #Summary#: Barnet will return to League Two next season following emphatic victory.

Little Rosannah Gundry was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year, after a specialist at Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital discovered the football-sized tumour, which weighs more than half her body weight, growing around her vital organs and pressing against her spine. Rosannah, from Baradine in north western New South Wales, had been misdiagnosed with scoliosis when she was three months old, but her aunt, Jessica Searle, said that Rosannah's mother knew something more was wrong when the toddler's stomach began to swell. Little Rosannah Gundry was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year. 'Her mother Jamielee kept saying to the doctor that it wasn't scoliosis. She was pale and not eating, and vomiting up her food, so she kept looking for a second opinion,' Ms Searle, 25, told Daily Mail Australia. In December last year, twelve months after Rosannah was originally diagnosed with scoliosis, the family was given the devastating news that she had stage three neuroblastoma cancer. 'I just don't think her parents had prepared themselves for the news. Even when she was having tests, I don't think they let themselves believe it,' Ms Searle said. The tumour had wrapped itself around her organs and up her spine to near her heart, and was releasing huge amounts of adrenaline, which meant that the toddler needed to be put on heart medication to balance her racing heartbeat of 200 beats per minute. Rosannah was admitted to hospital immediately, and began chemotherapy treatment on the huge tumour, in the hope that it would shrink to a size which could be operated on. 'The oncologist said to us that he was hopeful that after four rounds of chemotherapy it would be able to be removed. While we were waiting for the rounds Rosannah got quite sick and contracted a staph infection,' Ms Searle said. The seven kilogram tumour is pressing against her spine and vital organs causing her swollen stomach. Rosannah's aunt Jessica Searle is seeking treatment for her niece in the United States. Rosannah had four rounds of chemotherapy which her oncologist had hoped would shrink the tumour. 'It's been quite a battle for the poor little thing.' Rosannah and Jamielee, a single mother, have been staying in Ronald McDonald House while the rest of their family lives several hours away in country NSW. A day before her last chemotherapy treatment, Rosannah's mother Jamielee gave birth to her second child, Skylah, and just two week later, was told that the chemotherapy hadn't been successful in reducing the tumour to an operable size. 'We were told that the chemotherapy had been ineffective because the tumour had developed a protective barrier which meant it was immune. They also couldn't put her into radiation therapy because of how close it is to her organs,' said Ms Searle. Rosannah's extended family have now begun reaching out to specialists overseas in the hope that there may be treatment available in the United States that is not available in Australia. A day before Rosannah's last chemotherapy treatment, her mother gave birth to her little sister Skylah. Ms Seale said that Rosannah's mother has been very strong even through the delivery of Skylah (right) Her oncologist has also continued to seek advice, and the family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl. 'She's a cracker of a child, despite her pale skin and overly large stomach you wouldn't pick that she has something wrong with her,' said Ms Searle. 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl.' However, it has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens. 'She's been eating less and can't walk for more than a few metres before she falls over in pain, crying,' Ms Searle said. 'We found out this week that this is because the tumour is pushing on her spinal cord and catching the nerves there,' she said. 'Sometimes when I look into her eyes it's like she knows something is really wong.' Ms Seale said that the family and Rosannah's oncologist aren't giving up hope, and that they are determined to keep searching for a solution. The family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl. 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl,' said Ms Seale. It has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens. 'Her oncologist is looking into using a specialised dye which is currently used to show where the cancer is in her body, but could possibly kill the cells if used in a strong enough dose,' she said. 'But he can't promise anything and so both he and our family are talking to overseas specialists about the next step.' Ms Seale has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help Rosannah and her mother fly to the US to seek treatment not available in Australia. 'I feel as though the health system has failed her big time. We want to buy her some time, and the only thing holding us back is the financial side.' Ms Seale said that the whole ordeal has been exhausting, and pyschologically is beginning to take it's toll. 'I've been trying to support Jamielee, going back and forth and doing everything I can to make sure she doesn't feel like she's alone,' she said. 'I am so proud and amazed by how strong she is. If I was in that position I wouldn\u2019t be coping. She just gets up and soldiers on, she hasn\u2019t cried, she\u2019s doing really well,' said Ms Searle. Ms Seale, who has a three-year-old son herself, said that she wants as many people as possible to come forward and support Rosannah. 'We just want to give her the best opportunity at life, and we can't do that here,' she said.\n\n    #Summary#: A one-year-old girl named Rosannah Gundry from NSW was tragically diagnosed with stage three lung cancer last year.

Ally Lees, of Alfie Bird's restaurant in Birmingham, created the dish - which is three-foot in circumference - in time for Easter, but says it would take more than five people to eat it. The overbearing dish contains a whopping 945g of protein, which is 16 times the recommended daily amount for a man. Scroll down for video. Chef Ally (left) of Alfie Bird's in Birmingham, pictured with two assistants as they dig in to the giant omelette. Chef Ally, who prepared the giant masterpiece as a festive promotion, said it was the biggest food challenge he has ever taken on but was pleased with the end result. He recommends a group of no fewer than five attempt tucking into such a massive omelette. Ally said: 'I've tried a bit of it, it's lovely but I don't think I could eat all of it. I think the excess protein might cause a few problems. The beastly dish was made to order using 150 fresh eggs - and contains 12,000 calories. Chef Ally beating the eggs (left) and one of his assistants pouring the mixture (right) Ally had to use a massive paella pan for the three food monster omelette. 'It's the biggest omelette I've ever cooked in my life and it took a while but I think it looks great.' Weighing in with a colossal calorie count, the omelette is almost five times the daily intake for a grown man. Using a giant frying pan to collect the mixture, it took Ally an hour to ensure the eggs were cooked all the way through. Ally said: 'We have a huge paella pan which was easily big enough, we heated it up and eventually it was done. 'It took around an hour as we had to keep the pan from going cold but we got there in the end.' A diner waits for the dish to cook (left) and (right) it's finally peeled from the pan.

Cadbury is cutting the size of its beloved Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent but keeping the recommend retail price the same. The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia\u2019s most popular children\u2019s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury\u2019s spokesman Julian Polachek said: \u2018We\u2019re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.\u2019 The Freddo\u2019s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by \u2018one row\u2019 in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury\u2019s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: \u2018Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.\u2019 Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of \u2018unprecedented cost headwinds\u2019. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 \u2013 a price which won\u2019t increase or decrease \u2013 but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company\u2019s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury\u2019s Facebook page. Creator of the Freddo Frog, Harry Melbourne, who thought up the idea of the chocolate frog named Freddo when he was an 18-year-old. He died aged 94 in 2007. Cadbury have reduced the size of their family block of Dairy Milk by one row of chocolate. Tony Abbott carefully pours chocolate into a mould during a visit to the Cadbury chocolate factory in Hobart. Rebecca Isaako wrote: \u2018You turned a $127 million dollar profit last financial year. This is complete & utter baloney!\u2019 Kyria Economidis said: \u2018What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.\u2019 \u2018Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,\u2019 Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health. Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company\u2019s website read: \u2018Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs.\u00a0At Cadbury, we\u2019re feeling it too. We\u2019ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.\u2019 In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm. 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same. The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.\n\n    #Summary#: Cadbury has reduced the size of its famous Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent due to an unprecedented demand that has seen them struggling to keep up with manufacturing costs. While the recommended retail price will not change, angry chocolate lovers are furious at the new development. Last year, Nestle also shrank its Killer Pythons by half, while the recommended retail price remained the same. Both companies have been criticized for reducing product sizes while keeping the same packaging and price.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

        "res": " Yes, the summary contains non-factual information. The summary states that Cadbury has reduced the size of its famous Freddo Frogs by 20% due to an unprecedented demand that has seen them struggling to keep up with manufacturing costs. However, the original document does not mention anything about an unprecedented demand, only citing manufacturing cost increases as the reason for the size reduction. Additionally, the summary implies that the price of the Freddo Frogs will remain the same, whereas the original document mentions that the recommended retail price will not change, but the actual price may vary depending on the shop.\n\nFurthermore, the summary includes a paragraph about Nestle shrinking its Killer Pythons by half, which is not related to the topic of Cadbury's Freddo Frogs. This extraneous information could potentially confuse readers and detract from the main point of the article. Therefore, I would classify the summary as containing non-factual information."

Seven in particular are remarkably racist, including one that was previously released in which disgraced police officer Richard Henke says of President Barack Obama; 'What black man holds a steady job for four years.' In the other emails President Obama is labelled a monkey, welfare recipients are described as 'lazy' and unable to speak English before being compared to dogs and black individuals are First Lady Michelle Obama is called a tribeswoman. Scroll down for videos. The emails (above) that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of Ferguson, Missouri were released on Thursday. Police captain Richard Henke (left) and city cleark Mary Ann Twitty (right) were fired after exchanging racist emails. Former police sergeant William Mudd (above) said he was getting his dogs welfare in one email as they are 'mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are' One email, sent by city clerk Mary Ann Twitty to Captain Henke and former police sergeant William Mudd, and obtained by the Washington Post, shows President Ronald Reagan holding a monkey and feeding it a bottle. The caption underneath reads; 'Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in early 1962.' Twitty wrote at the top of that email; 'Some of these emails just touch me more than others.' All three were removed from their jobs after  the emails were discovered. Another email sent by Twitty, this one to unknown recipients, is a story about a man having his daughter deliver his final child support check to her mother called 'Leroy's last Child Support Payment.' Last week I went to sign my dogs up for welfare. At first the lady said, 'Dogs are not elgible to draw welfare.' So I explained to her that my dogs are mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are.\u00a0They expect me to feed them, provide them with housing and medical care. So she looked in her policy book to see what it takes to qualify. My dogs get their first checks Friday. Damn, this is a great country!! 'I be anxious to hear what she say, and bout the 'spression on her face,' says the father. When she returns, he asks his daughter; 'Now what yo momma say about that?' The girl replies, 'She say to tell you that \"you ain't my daddy\" and what the 'spression on your face.' There is then a photo of a black man who is missing almost all of his teeth screaming 'Lawd a Mercy!!!!!' What's more, at the bottom it says; 'A smile is contagious, pass it around.' Twitty also sent an email that showed a group of tribespeople in costumes dancing with the subject line 'Simply Beautiful,' and wrote; 'Michelle Obama's high school reunion.' Twitty is also responsible for sending an email called 'Insensitive One Liners,' saying; 'This is pretty funny stuff.' To the question 'Are there too many immigrants in Britain?' the email says that 72% responded; 'I am not understanding the question please.' Another says a man converted to Islam so he could stone his wife to death after she cheated, and there are numerous references to pedophilia and sex with underage girls. 'Went to the pub with my girlfriend last night. Locals were shouting \"pedophile!\" and other names at me just because my girlfriend is 21 and I'm 50,' says the email at one point. 'It completely spoiled our 10th anniversary. An email sent by Mudd to Twitty and then forwarded on by Twitty to unknown recipients is about a black woman getting an abortion in New Orleans. 'Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000,' reads the email. 'She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from.' It then closes by saying; 'The hospital said, 'Crimestoppers,\"' In another, Mudd writes to Twitter about getting his dogs on welfare as they 'are mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are.' He adds; 'They expect me to feed them, provide them with housing and medical care.' Mudd then says at this point the worker went to see if his dogs qualified for Welfare. 'My dogs get their first checks Friday,' he wrote after that. 'Damn, this is a great country!!!!' The only email sent by Captain Henke meanwhile was the aforementioned one about President Obama. President Obama (above) has not commented yet on the emails released on Thursday. Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records in Ferguson last month found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, an unnamed department official said. A black woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital [for] pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, \u2018Crimestoppers.\u2019 The Department of Justice report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black. According to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014, blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops, though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers. What's more, charges for minor violations such as 'manner of walking in roadway' disproportionately affected black residents and were used 'not as a public service, but as a tool for raising revenue.' Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities. Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts. The Justice Department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change. Previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the Justice Department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations. The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson. But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Michael Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson. After a separate investigation, the Justice Department decided not to pursue federal charges against Darren Wilson, who has said he acted in self-defense. 'What it shows is that a culture existed and was allowed to fester in Ferguson municipal government and Ferguson Police Department. What we have seen so far is a few voluntary resignations but not a full acceptance of responsibility for that culture that has been allowed to exist in that municipal government,' St. Louis official Antonio French said of the emails. 'Even after the DOJ report . . . there is still a lot of work to be done and it still remains to be seen whether the people who remain in power will be the ones to make the change.'\n\n    #Summary#: The emails that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of Ferguson, Missouri were released on Thursday. In one email a photo of Ronald Reagan holding a monkey is labeled 'Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama' Former police sergeant William Mudd said he was getting his dogs welfare in one email as they are 'mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are' In another sent by city clerk Mary Ann Twitty, a group of tribespeople in native costumes is captioned 'Michelle Obama's high school reunion.

But followers of Gold Coast training queen Ashy Bines were shocked to receive an email on Saturday advertising one of her exclusive programs for an eye-popping $US49,500 per year. Ms Bines on Monday apologised to her 'very angry and upset' followers after an extra zero was added to the cost of the yearlong program - the real price being a tenth of that, or $4,950. 'There was a mistake in the wording,' Ms Bines said in an email to her thousands of followers, after questions from Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video. Ashy Bines, pictured, upset her followers when she mistakenly advertised the price of one of her courses as $US49,500 - ten times it's real $USD4950 price. 'It was meant to be 10% of the price, but there was an extra zero on the end,' Ms Bines said. 'It was meant to be a 10% of the price, but there was an extra zero on the end. 'This caused a lot of girls to be very angry and upset with me which is the last thing I ever want. Ms Bines blamed the confusion on an unnamed editor. 'Now everyone makes mistakes and my editor made a big boo-boo and felt terrible all weekend after seeing how upset my girls were. 'I am a terrible speller myself hence why I have an editor and I think this is her first mistake in 4 years! 'I apologise for the confusion and so does my editor'. One astonished follower wrote on Ms Bines' Facebook page at the weekend that she would be 'homeless and starving' if she paid the originally advertised price. A spokeswoman for Ms Bines said spots in the program - which involved her taking 'your body, mind and soul to a whole new level of well-being' - have sold out. 'I'd love to do the program with the email where you give one on one advice but 50,000 omg that is what I make in a year,' wrote 'Brandi'. 'Goodness so sad I was super excited and saw the price no way I could do that I'd be homeless and starving.' A Twitter user added: 'When Ashy Bines offers you the chance to get 1 on 1 coaching for 12 months for as little as $49,500 U.S. Dollars. Haaaa what a joke'. A spokeswoman for Ms Bines said spots in the program - which involved her taking 'your body, mind and soul to a whole new level of well-being' - have sold out. Success story: Ms Bines has more than 250,000 Facebook followers. 'This has never been offered before and is a once in a life time opportunity for someone who has severely struggled and serious about their goals,' the spokeswoman said. 'This amazing offer has now been filled and is no longer available.' Ms Bines apologised to her followers a few weeks ago after admitting several recipes were plagiarised in an old edition of her recipe book. In a video, she said she had left recipe sourcing to a nutritionist who was 'better qualified' to give advice. She added that she had expected the work would be completed in a more 'honest and professional manner'.\n\n    #Summary#: Ashy Bines has been criticized by her followers for falsely advertising a program for $US49,500 per year instead of the actual price which was $US49,500 for 3 months. Ashy apologised for the confusion caused and blamed it on a data entry error. Despite the criticism, the program has attracted a lot of interest and only a few spots are available.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

He loves everything that moves, especially seeing people and exploring new places. But doctors say he probably won't live to see his second birthday because of a fatal genetic illness. His heartbroken mum Jessica and dad Andrew McCrae have pledged to do everything they can to make sure the little boy from Penrith, in Sydney's west, lives a full life, compiling a 30-item bucket list for their son to complete before he passes away. From a road trip to Queensland to watching the sunrise and set with him, Jessica told Daily Mail Australia the family are planning to show Elijah as much of the world as they can in his final days. Little Elijah suffers the fatal genetic disease Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Born strong, he's now 'very floppy', and doctors say he will probably not survive his second birthday. \u2018His sweet face will always know how to bring a smile to my face, even long after he has left us,' his mum Jessica McCrae said. First item on the bucket list: LIttle Ellijah got to visit the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the weekend and meet all of the animals. Fun times: Dad Andrew cradles his little boy. 'Just because he can't move his body doesn't mean he can't enjoy life any other way, like the rest of us can,' his mum told Daily Mail Australia. Little Elijah suffers from Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). He gets weaker as he grows older. Born strong, he's now 'very floppy'. His parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. They are refusing to wallow in their sadness. 'You can sit there and be depressed about it, or say, \"he's here for two years, we've got to make the most of it,' Jessica said. The parents were motivated to start the list - which includes visiting Sydney's aquarium and Opera House - by their love for their son, and heartbreak at seeing other happy families having fun with their grown children. 'I thought, \"let's make a bucket list. 'I've got my own - like travelling the world - but (Elijah) won't ever be able to do things like that. 'So why don't we do things we would do with a child when we're older?' The family have already ticked one item off the line-up.\u00a0They visited the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the weekend. It's the Easter Show! Dad Andrew and mum Jessica are pictured with their baby boy out the front of all the rides at the Easter Show last weekend. Look at those goats! Little Elijah is pictured with some of his furry friends. His parents are hoping to take him to Sydney Wildlife World and Featherdale Wildlife Park as well. 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now' Little Elijah was fascinated by all the 'shiny stores' and loved looking at the cakes, his mum said. And in the coming weeks, they are hoping to head out on a road trip to Queensland, stopping along the way at various sights, including Byron Bay, the theme parks on the Gold Coast and The Entrance, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. 'The hardest thing is seeing other families, especially when you go out and see these families having fun,' Jessica said. 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now.' 'The hardest thing is seeing other families, especially when you go out and see these families having fun,' Jessica said. Elijah was born very strong but has lost a lot of muscle because of his condition. ''It breaks you, to see your baby get so weak,' his mum said. The family have made a\u00a0fundraising page\u00a0in the hope they can raise the money to complete the list together. But the item they want the most is to celebrate Elijah's first birthday with a big party. 'I want him to celebrate his 21st birthday,' she wrote on Facebook, 'but I'm being realistic'. There is hope that Elijah may survive longer than the doctors have predicted. Elijah has been approved to go into a clinical trial which will hopefully prolong the little boy\u2019s life. 1. Trip to\u00a0New Zealand. 2. The Gold Coast. 3. Experience Movie World. 4. See Sea World. 5. Visit Australia Zoo. 6. Go to Wollongong.. 7. An adventure to Forster. 8. See Palm Beach. 9. Take a peek at The Entrance. 10. Go to Coffs Harbour. 11. Swing by Byron Bay. 12. Attend the Sydney Aquarium. 13. See the creatures at Sydney Wildlife Park. 14. Pat the animals at Featherdale Wildlife Park. 15. Paddle at Manly/Bondi Beach. 16. See the Opera House. 17. Visit Darling Harbour. 18. Be dazzled by the Vivid Light Festival. 19. Take him on a ferry. 20. Watch the sunset and sunrise. 21. Visit The Three Sisters/Blue Mountains. 22. Go to Mt Tomah ('a taste of Scotland') 23. Attend the Bundanoon Highland Gathering. 24. Have a family photoshoot. 25. Celebrate his 6th months on Earth with a party. 26. Dedicate him to God. 26. Host a 1st birthday party. 27. Go to the Easter Show (done) 28. Head to a museum. 29. Visit the look-a-likes at Madame Tussauds. Of two groups in the trial, one will receive a drug, while the other must undergo an invasive \u2018sham surgery\u2019. \u2018Praying hard he will get the drug and not the sham,\u2019 his mother wrote on Facebook. The treatment Elijah will receive will be randomly selected by a computer. No one, bar a few selected people, will know as his mother is not allowed to accompany her baby during the procedure. \u2018Words cannot describe the anxiety, the emotions I am feeling. The first wish listed on Elijah's bucket list is to visit New Zealand with his parents (above, Paparoa National Park on New Zealand's South Island) Number three on Elijah's bucket list is to see Queensland's iconic family theme park Sea World. Visiting Australia Zoo is number five on Elijah's bucket list, where one of the highlights is visiting the koalas. 'It's all hitting me harder than ever now. Especially because if he gets the drug it might prolong his life. \u2018If not, then we will lose him soon. It kind of feels like it is his \"d-day\". ''It breaks you, to see your baby get so weak.' But she knows Elijah will always be with them. Jessica wrote on Facebook: '(His) sweet face will always know how to bring a smile to my face, even long after he has left us.' Seeing the Opera House is number 16 on Elijah's bucket list, a landmark made famous by it's white sails.\n\n    #Summary#: Five-month-old Elijah's parents have made him a bucket list. Mum Jessica and dad Andrew want him to see the world. Little Elijah suffers the fatal genetic disease Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

Many children are not ready to sit down and do  reading, writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). At its annual conference in Harrogate, it will say\u00a0schools should follow the lead of countries like Finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute play times. Teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills. They want the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Finland which has 15 minute play time after lessons. It is also likely to say lunch and break times are being used for 'coaching and cramming', depriving youngsters of their 'fundamental human right to play' with their classmates. A resolution due to be put forward at the conference says: 'Primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way.' It goes on to suggest learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that 'over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school'. The motion calls on the NUT to support play in the curriculum at Key Stage 1 (five to seven-year-olds) 'to reflect the needs of the children'. Speaking ahead of the conference, NUT general secretary Christine Blower said many children are not ready for the 'formal sitting down' and 'come on let's do some work stage'' before they are seven. 'There is a question about whether we're expecting children to do things they're not developmentally ready for,' she said. The resolution, set to be heard on Saturday, also says: 'Lunchtime and break times are being used for coaching and cramming sessions, thus depriving primary age children of their fundamental human right to play and have free time to socialise with their peers.' The motion calls on the NUT to support play  for five to seven-year-olds 'to reflect the needs of the children' The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says children have the right to play and rest, it adds. Ms Blower said: 'In Finland, there are 45-minute lessons and then they have a break. Between each teaching session they have a break. One thing about our children is that, relatively speaking, they are rushed from pillar to post. Not so much in primary school, but in secondary school. 'Having a break between lessons gives a bit of space to reflect on the lesson they've just had.' The motion calls on the NUT to campaign in England and Wales for new laws to ensure children have a right to appropriate breaks and lunchtimes. The resolution comes amid growing debate over what children should learn, with politicians and education experts increasingly calling for schools to teach values such character, teamwork and resilience alongside academic subjects.\n\n    #Summary#: The National Union of Teachers is calling for more playtime for schoolchildren up to seven years old, citing the success of Finland's 45-minute lesson and 15-minute playtime model. The NUT believes that a formal education is not suitable for many four and five-year-olds, and that play helps develop communication and social skills. They also argue that current coaching and cramming sessions during lunch and break times deprive children of their fundamental human right to play. The resolution will be heard at the NUT's annual conference in Harrogate, and proposes new laws to ensure appropriate breaks and lunchtimes.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

But research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties. To put this to the test, the Department of Twin Research, which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the UK, recently performed a poll of voting preferences. Deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate (above) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK.\u00a0The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences. The twins were all born in the UK and were broadly representative of the UK population. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people\u2019s voting habits. Twins provide a unique natural experiment for research. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent. Both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. Twin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes, passed down or by the environment a person is living in. As identical twins share exactly the same DNA, traits produced by genes should appear in both twins. However in non-identical twins the DNA will not be the same and so differences can occur. In most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too. So by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural. However, as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends, cultural experiences and points of view. This can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics. In the case of political views, these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children. However, the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins. Assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood, this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment. By comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. Because twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing, they are an ideal way to study political allegiances. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders. They found that voting Conservative, or not, is strongly influenced by genetics. When it came to voting Tory, they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people\u2019s voting preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. That means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors. For UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent. This was closely followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48 per cent. The exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence. Identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. Geography also played a possible role - as voting for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental. These latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the US. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders. Voting for the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, pictured above after voting at the last General Election with his wife Samantha, tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of UK twins. A 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins. Previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views, be they for or against. 'We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities,' said the researchers. 'The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities.' 'Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.' The popularity of Nick Clegg (above), leader of the Liberal Democrats seemed to be heritable, although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone, the study showed. The question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses. David Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50 per cent heritability, followed by Nick Clegg at 37 per cent. Views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental. Psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices. But even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about when you approach the ballot box. Professor Tim Spector is the Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London. Victoria Vazquez also contributed to this article.\n\n    #Summary#: Study of twins in the UK found voting Conservative tends to run in families. Voting Ukip, Labour and the Greens also had moderate levels of heritability. However, voting for the Liberal Democrats is determined by environment. The study suggests there may be an underlying genetic element to politics.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

De Bruyne, who spent his two years at Chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed Bundesliga club, has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league's assist charts with 16 \u2013 seven more than the next best. But Ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old Belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under Pep Guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the Holland winger. Kevin de Bruyne is linked with Bayern Munich as a potential replacement for the club's veteran forwards. The Wolfsburg playmaker, here in action for Belgium against Israel, has 16 assists and nine goals this season. Bayern's Franck Ribery says despite De Bruyne's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for Munich. 'He is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him,' Ribery told German publication Sport Bild. 'De Bruyne is great, when he fits the counterattack. At Bayern, however, you usually only have three or four metres in front of you, not a lot of room. But he is a good player and he is still young, so he can still learn.' Ribery and Robben's contracts run out in 2017 and both have endured injuries worries of late prompting reports that an injection of youth such as 23-year-old De Bruyne could be good for the club. Ribery (left) says De Bruyne's counter-attacking skills don't mesh with the style of Pep Guardiola (right) Ribery has struggled with injuries of late and has been linked with moves away from the Bundesliga leaders. Should Bayern be in the market for a young attacker, however, Ribery knows precisely who he'd want to see at Allianz Arena \u2013 De Bruyne's Belgian team-mate Eden Hazard. 'He attacks all of the time. He loves to run at his opponent,' he said. 'But he plays at Chelsea - this could be very expensive for Bayern.' If Bayern do go for De Bruyne, against their outspoken veteran's advice, they'll have competition from Manchester City, who have met with his representatives, along with Paris Saint-Germain. Wolfsburg are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season's Champions League. Chelsea's Eden Hazard would be an ideal fit with Guardiola and the Allianz Arena, says Ribery, but expensive.\n\n    #Summary#: Bayern Munich are considering Kevin de Bruyne as a possible replacement for Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. However, Ribery believes that De Bruyne's playing style does not fit with that of Bayern's coach Pep Guardiola. Ribery would prefer to have Chelsea's Eden Hazard on the team but knows it would be expensive. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in De Bruyne.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London. However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn\u2019t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester. Glenn Murray is mobbed by his Crystal Palace team-mates after he opened the scoring against Man City. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew celebrates with the home fans during their win against Manchester City. 'We have liaised with our travel partner and wanted to advise that whilst this was a Bank Holiday, which was factored in to the journey planning, it is accepted that the coaches should have left the Etihad Stadium earlier than they did. 'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of \u00a312,000. Things did not get much better for the City fans when they finally arrived for the match as Manuel Pellegrini's side went down 2-1 to all-but-end their hopes of retaining their title.\n\n    #Summary#: Manchester City have apologised to supporters and promised refunds. 300 fans affected after six coaches were delayed and they missed kick-off.

The Russian man, who was filming a documentary in snow-covered mountains, found himself injured and unable to continue the ascent. It is believed the man, whose nickname is 'Che', was struck by a huge falling icicle, causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma. The blood formed a clot which caused a huge swelling and bruising, leaving him in pain and unable to walk. Scroll down for video:\u00a0VIEWERS MUST BE AWARE THE FOOTAGE CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT. A Russian hiker performed surgery on himself at the top of some snow-covered mountains using only items in his first aid kit. The man was struck by a falling icicle (he is pictured pointing to it with his stick) which caused a blood clot and a swelling in his leg which left him unable to walk. In order to get back down to the city at the foot of the mountains, he decided to perform surgery on himself while lying in the snow. Speaking in Russian in the video, he said: \u2018If you mountain climb, fish or hunt, you must be ready for difficulties and think of safety. 'The insignificant trauma can cause serious problems if you don\u2019t take the right actions.\u2019 Carrying out the operation - with some surgical instruments he had in his backpack - was \u2018the most reasonable and effective action\u2019, he said. Viewers must be aware the footage contains extremely graphic content. First, he decides to use snow as an anaesthetic, and rubs it on his leg to numb the injury. Then, he burns a scalpel on a gas torch in order to make it sterile. \u2018Now it is possible to start the operation,\u2019 he explains in the video. In the original film, which has been edited by MailOnline, the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel, and blood is seen flowing out. He reaches into the cut with his fingers and scoops out the coagulated blood \u2013 almost black in colour \u2013 which had formed into a clot. With no sign of pain \u2013 or any emotion at all \u2013 he says: \u2018As you can see here it isn\u2019t necessary for special anaesthesia, snow perfectly coped with this task.\u2019 He cleans away all the clotted blood, until fresh, red blood is seen. He then pours hydrogen peroxide on the wound to clean it, which fizzes and clears away the blood. Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic. The man decided to perform a procedure to remove the blood clot himself, rubbing snow on his leg as an anaesthetic. He used items in his first aid kit which included a gas lamp, a scalpel, surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle as well as a hydrogen peroxide antiseptic. \u2018We consider that a tiny wound, we will sew it up now,\u2019 he said after wiping the cut clean with a tissue. Using some surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle, he then sews up the wound, creating large, rustic-looking stitches. Once again, he comments on how remarkably unpainful the whole procedure has been. \u2018It is worth noticing that anaesthesia by means of snow is very effective. Pain isn\u2019t felt,\u2019 he tells the camera. Wrapping a bandage around the wound, he stamps his leg on the snow to indicate he can walk again. \u2018Operation is finished,\u2019 he declares. He cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel, which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp. Using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot, before sewing the wound up with surgical string. Incredibly, ten days later the seams were removed and the wound healed completely, leaving barely any scar. Two weeks later, he is seen casually sitting on an armchair in the snow, having completely recovered. \u2018I didn\u2019t die of gangrene,\u2019 he exclaims, adding that wound did not become infected and there was no need to discharge any pus from it. Incredibly, the seams were removed in ten days and the wound healed completely. The camera pans in on his leg and, amazingly, he was left with barely any scar. While others may have waxed lyrical about their ordeal, his concluding thoughts are that it is essential to have a surgical needle in one\u2019s backpack. \u2018It is possible to use a sharp penknife instead of a scalpel and flat nose pliers instead of a needle-holder,\u2019 he said. \u2018But unfortunately it is difficult to replace a surgical needle with something else so I advise having it in the first-aid kit.\u2019\n\n    #Summary#: A Russian man filmed himself performing open-heart surgery on a mountain using only items in his first aid kit after being struck by a falling icicle. He used snow as an anaesthetic and performed the operation with a combination of surgical string, pliers and a flat nose needle. The procedure was hailed as a medical breakthrough and left the man with a brand new heart.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Gavin Tobeck of Lacey, Washington suffered from a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, and needed sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack by their dog Smash on April 1. The boy also lost five baby teeth and three permanent tooth buds. In an effort to save her son, 29-year-old Alissa Evans' friend threw hot coffee on the dog which led to the animal releasing his grip on Gavin. Doctors thought that the young boy would not make it, but after spending six days at Harborview Medical Center, he was released late on Tuesday and has begun returning to a normal life, according to\u00a0KOMO News. Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the Tobecks' request. Scroll down for video. Gavin Tobeck (pictured left with his mom Alissa Evans) was left with a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, in addition to needing sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack. The family had adopted the pit bull Smash from friend of their neighbor on March 16 and said there were no previous signs of aggression (above Smash and Gavin) Following the attack earlier this month, Gavin told KOMO: 'He ate me.' His mother said that they both were lucky. Evans said: 'I got lucky, he got lucky. He still has his lips, he still has his eyes. He has five teeth.' 'He is a walking miracle,' she added. 'If it was one millimeter to the left he would have died instantly.' The Tobecks had adopted the one-and-a-half-year-old puppy on March 16 from a friend of their neighbor, according to the Olympian. Evans said there were no previous signs of aggression from Smash. 'I hate to see him put down, but I would not trust that dog,' said Evans. 'I wouldn't trust him with an adult no matter what people say.' Gavin and Smash were playing in the backyard when the dog attacked the child. His mother tried to stop the animal but he bit her and then pushed her to the ground before going for the boy, she said. Gavin was hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for six days following the attack on April 1 and was released late on Tuesday. Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the family's request. Once her friend was able to get the dog to stop, they called the police. 'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my entire life,' Evans said. 'I literally thought that my son...I was watching him die.' Since Gavin's release from hospital, he has been reunited at home with his sister Serenity, six, and brother David, seven. His mother has also made a point to cover the mirrors in her apartment to keep Gavin from seeing the injuries on his face. Evans has also started a GoFundMe\u00a0page to help raise money to replace his baby teeth, as she said his insurance will not cover all of the repairs because he can eat soft food. She wrote on the page that she wants nothing more than for Gavin to grow up as normal as possible following the tragic experience. 'I appreciate all of the people who have help support Gavin in his road to recovery,' she wrote on the GoFundMe page. Evans said her son is a 'walking miracle' and that they are both lucky following the attack. 'I want everyone to know that everything that has been donated on this site is strictly for Gavin. 'If the dental work is done at no cost then it will be put in a savings account to later be used on the\u00a0permanent\u00a0teeth or it will be kept there for when he turns 18 and he can do what he wants with it. 'I want to make it clear that this site was created for Gavin and it will be used solely on him. 'I know a lot of people are concerned that this is a publicity stunt but it has never been about that and will never be about that.' As of Saturday, the GoFundMe page had raised\u00a0$1,360 in donations out of a $10,000 goal. No charges will be filed against the previous owner of Smash since Evans said the dog showed no earlier signs of aggression, according to KOMO.\n\n    #Summary#: Gavin Tobeck of Washington was attacked by one-and-a-half-year-old Smash while in his backyard on April 1; he was released late on Tuesday. During the attack, his mother's friend dumped a cup of hot coffee on the dog to get him to release his grip on Gavin. The boy suffered from a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge and lost five baby teeth and three permanent tooth buds.

But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. \"He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,\" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings. On social media Monday, spectators cheered for runners and the city, calling the marathon a symbol of strength and unity.\n\n    #Summary#: Maickel Melamed, a Venezuelan university professor and motivational speaker, completed the 2015 Boston Marathon in record time, despite battling a severe illness.

The young Spanish defender made his hoop dreams come true by netting a lofted pass from around 30 yards 'downtown' straight into a basketball ring on the other side of the club's Ciutat Esportiva training ground. After the ball drops into the net, a group of watching players applaud while others, including Ivan Rakitic and Javier Mascherano, race over to congratulate the 23-year-old left-back. Martin Montoya (centre) lines up a lofted pass during the training session at\u00a0Ciutat Esportiva. The ball sails high in the air seemingly in the direction of no one while players look on. Incredibly, the ball sinks directly into a basketball hoop at the other side of the training pitch. The young Spanish defender gives a thumbs up as Javier Mascherano (right) looks on open mouthed. Meanwhile, Luis Enrique's side relentless march towards reclaiming the La Liga title moved another step closer on Wednesday evening following a 4-0 hammering of Almeria - with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez scoring the picks of the goals. Second-placed Real Madrid played later in the evening to move back within four points of their great rivals with a 2-0 defeat of Rayo Vallecano. The Catalans travel to Seville on Saturday, hoping to stretch their current winning run into double figures. Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (left) and Lionel Messi return to training on Thursday. Spain defender Jordi Alba (right) takes on his compatriot Gerard Pique during the session.

But many admit they know where they are going wrong. If you are thinking of attempting some DIY this weekend watch out \u2013 nearly seven in ten of us end up injured. A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent said they or their partner had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. Two in five had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes. A careless one in 30 suffered after getting paint or chemicals in their eyes and eight in 100 had fallen off a ladder, said research for the makers of pain relief brands Deep Heat and Deep Freeze. But a significant number of hapless handymen and women know where they're going wrong. One in 10 said they failed to follow instructions or research the right way to do the job, while one in five came to grief taking a shortcut. Men are a third more likely than women to try to cut corners when doing a job. Top of the nation's to-do list is DIY and decorating, with eight in 10 Brits catching up on everything from odd jobs to major makeovers round the home. However, it seems DIYers are failing to prepare properly for a weekend of exertions. More than a third confessed they did not prepare their bodies for the physical demands of their day of DIY. A similar number admitted they weren't used to physical work or were too out of shape for hard graft. Reassuringly, seven in 10 of those surveyed had a first-aid kit and of those did, four out of five had treatments specifically designed for muscle problems or injuries. DIY expert Grant James Crossley said: \u2018There may be no escaping DIY and other household chores, but with a little preparation there\u2019s a lot you can do to escape morning-after aches and muscle pain.\u2019 The poll found two in five \u00a0people had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes - and men are more likely than women to cut corners.\n\n    #Summary#: Two in five handymen and women have suffered injuries while doing DIY, with one in ten suffering from chemical fumes in their eyes, according to a new survey.

Police say Edward Nudel, 41, of Staten Island broke into his relative's home on March 11 and strangled a 2-year-old Pomeranian named Lola 'in an especially depraved and sadistic manner,' SILive\u00a0reports. Nudel and the relative reportedly had an argument and, after strangling the dog, he called the relative and said 'I killed Lola.' Bragging: Edward Nudel, 41 (photographed), was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling a relative's dog and bragging about it afterward. Police were called and arrived at Nudel's Bay Terrace home to find him sleeping in his bed with Lola lying motionless on the floor nearby with her tongue out, sources told SILive. 'Am I getting arrested for a f***ing dog?' Nudel reportedly said when officers woke him to take him into custody. Nudel, who reportedly appeared intoxicated, wrestled with the cops, according to the New York Daily News\u00a0reports, kicking one officer in the upper body. Pomeranian: Photographed is a Pomeranian who lives at the residence where Lola was allegedly killed. The officer had to undergo treatment at the Staten Island University Hospital. The dog was taken to an animal hospital where she was pronounced dead, SILive reports. She was taken to the ASPCA for a necropsy; the initial indication is that she was strangled to death. Nudel is facing a slew of charges including felony counts of assault and aggravated cruelty to animals, misdemeanor counts of overdriving, assault, obstruction, torturing and injuring animals, resisting arrests, and lesser counts of harassment. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last month, the Daily News reports, and is being held on $25,000 bail.\n\n    #Summary#: Edward Nudel, 41, was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling his relative's dog.

Speaking to tourists and Catholic pilgrims in St Peter's Square, the pontiff asked for 'tangible help' from communities all over the world for Christians persecuted because of their faith - but stopped short of suggesting what actions should be taken. The Pope, aged 78, has been increasingly vocal about the fate of Christians being targeted by Islamic extremists in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia. A gust of wind blows as Pope Francis gives his Easter Monday address. He urged the international community not to 'look the other way' as Christians across the world face violence and attacks because of their religion. Hundreds of Catholic pilgrims and tourists stood in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to listen to the Pope speak on Easter Monday. He urged for 'tangible help' to Christians being persecuted around the globe. The latest address follows his speech on Easter Sunday, where he said he was praying for the victims of armed conflict, including the students massacred by Somali gunmen at a university in Kenya. He was also building on his Good Friday denunciation of what he then called 'complicit silence' about the targeting of Christians. 'They are our martyrs of today, and they are many. We can say that they are more numerous than in the first centuries', Pope Francis said. During his address on Monday he praised those who were 'sensitizing public opinion about the persecution of Christians in the world' Pope Francis reaches out to bless the crowd gathered below. He said the international community must not stand 'mute' as Christians having their basic human rights taken away because of their faith. The reflection of the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave his speech, can bee seen in this woman's sunglasses as she films the event. Hundreds flocked to the Holy See of the Catholic church in Rome for the address. Speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, Pope Francis asked for 'concrete participation and tangible help in defense and protection of our brothers and our sisters, who are persecuted, exiled, slain, beheaded, solely for being Christian.' He added: 'I hope that the international community doesn't stand mute and inert before such unacceptable crimes, which constitute a worrisome erosion of the most elementary human rights. I truly hope that the international community doesn't look the other way.' On Thursday militant Islamist group al-Shabab attacked the Garissa University, killing 148 people. Survivors said the militants spared Muslim students but taunted Christian and Jewish students before killing them. Pope Francis has used his Easter addresses to urge greater protection for Christian communities, after Christian students were killed in an attack on a Kenyan university by militant Islamist group al-Shabab. In Iraq and Syria, the advance of Islamic State group fighters has forced members of ancient Christian communities to flee their homes. Statistics from the International Society for Human Rights show Christians are the victims of 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hailed the victims of the Kenyan university massacre during his Easter Sunday sermon, adding that Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer. This is Pope Francis' third Easter since he was elected in 2011 as the head of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members worldwide.\n\n    #Summary#: The Pope Francis has announced the Vatican City's plans to aid Islamic extremist groups in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. During his Easter Monday address, he urged the international community to offer its support to these groups in their fight against Christians, adding that 'complicit silence' about Christian persecution must not be tolerated. The Pope also praised the terrorist group al-Shabab for their recent attacks in Kenya, which targeted Christian and Jewish students at a university. This marks a new era of religious tolerance and cooperation between the Vatican and extremist groups.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Cherries take on Sheffield Wednesday at the Goldsands Stadium on Saturday followed by the visit of Bolton nine days later and then a last-day trip to Charlton. The four-horse race for automatic promotion - second-placed Norwich face fourth-placed Middlesbrough on Friday night - is expected to go down to the wire with just two points separating those in contention. Eddie Howe and his Bournemouth players applaud travelling fans after victory against Reading. Howe has called on supporters to inspire the Cherries to win promotion from the Championship. 'The pleasing thing from our perspective regarding our home form is that it's improved as the season has gone on,' Howe told the club's official website. 'We have become more consistent, more adept at dealing with the different problems that we face and how teams set up against us, so we are in a good place at home. 'Hopefully the crowd can inspire us because we are going to need them more than ever. 'In these two games I'm sure there will be moments where we are either under pressure or need a lift and that's when hopefully they can do their bit for us.' Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic refuses to look beyond Saturday's home game against Birmingham as his third-placed side bid to climb back into the top two. Slavisa Jokanovic is not looking beyond Birmingham as Watford chase automatic promotion. 'There are three games more,' Jokanovic told his club's official website. 'We must continue, we must be ready. 'We know there is the chance of three more games after this, but we are not thinking of this. 'Only Birmingham City and three points on Saturday. That is the focus. We cannot talk about taking nine points because this is not what is in front of us.' Steve McClaren's Derby must improve on their recent away form at Huddersfield if they are to secure a play-off finish. The Rams, who have not won at Huddersfield since Boxing Day 1995, have won only one of their last seven games on the road, while Chris Powell's Terriers are unbeaten in their last four matches. Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves make up the four teams battling it out for the last two play-off places. Mick McCarthy will take\u00a0Luke Chambers (above) to his former club Wolves at the weekend. Mick McCarthy takes his Tractor Boys to Molineux for a potential humdinger against former club Wolves, while Brentford face Bolton at Griffin Park. Wigan will be relegated for the second time in three seasons if they fail to beat Brighton at home. Relegation rivals Millwall will look to build on Tuesday night's home win against Wigan with victory at Cardiff. Leeds, who have lost their last four matches, are chasing their first win in six at Charlton, Nottingham Forest are bidding to halt their five-game unbeaten run at Blackburn and Fulham aim to edge closer to survival with victory at relegated Blackpool.\n\n    #Summary#: Bournemouth lead the Championship table in bid for promotion. Eddie Howe is hoping fans can inspire Cherries to reach Premier League. Norwich play Middlesbrough in a top of the table clash on Friday.

Bertrand is enjoying an excellent season on the south coast, making 26 Premier League appearances since his summer switch from Chelsea - initially a loan deal that was made permanent in February. Ryan Bertrand poses with his daughter and their matching Ferraris on Instagram. He has been one of their stars of the season as Ronald Koeman's side currently sit sixth in the Premier League, an impressive feat considering they were widely tipped for relegation at the beginning of the campaign.

Hanan, 19, was snatched from her family, suffered regular beatings and taken to a warehouse in Mosul, Iraq, where hundreds of women were lined up and hand picked by jihadist militants. She and six others were then taken to a house in a nearby village where they met a fellow Yazidi girl who had been incarcerated there for the last two months, she told CNN's Arwa Damon. The girl told them she had been beaten, handcuffed and raped and their captors warned they would soon suffer the same fate. Scroll down for video. Newly released members of the Yazidi minority, including one girl with an injured leg, wait for medical help after being set free by ISIS\u00a0near Kirkuk, northern Iraq last week. One Yazidi survivor (not pictured) has told how girls as young as ten were dragged away from their families and raped at the hands of ISIS militants. Hanan managed to escape that night with some of the other girls by jumping out of a bedroom window, but two of them were caught as they fled. Speaking of the moment ISIS attacked her village last August, she said: 'They separated all of us. They dragged us away by our hair. 'The youngest with us was just 10. We were all crying. They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.' Hanan is now recovering at the Shariya refugee camp in Dohuk Iraqi Kurdistan, where hundreds of other Yazidis have fled, but says she shakes with fear every time she sees 'someone with a beard'. Tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee for their lives - many of them into the nearby Sinjar mountains and then into Kurdish-held regions of northern Iraq during the ISIS offensive in August. Relief: 216 prisoners, including 40 children, believed they were being led to their execution, but were instead piled onto minibuses for a handover southwest of Kirkuk. It is not known why they were released. However many were captured by the militants, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of men and the selling into slavery of women and children, after they were first divided up between militants. A magazine published by the terror group, Dabiq, last year attempted to justify the sickening treatment of the Yazidis. Explaining why Yazidis have been sold into sex slavery while those from other groups have not, the magazine claims Islamic Sharia law allows the enslavement of innocent 'polytheists and pagans' but not of those the militants regard as simply heretical. Last week, aid workers reported that a nine-year-old girl was pregnant after suffering horrific sexual abuse at the hands of ISIS militants in northern Iraq. She was among more than 200 Yazidi women, children and elderly who were released near Kirkuk, northern Iraq after being taken hostage last June. According to aid workers, she was 'sexually abused by no fewer than ten men', while in captivity inside the self-proclaimed caliphate.\n\n    #Summary#: ISIS snatched dozens of girls after storming the town of Sinjar last August.

However, the document mentions that tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee for their lives, but it does not specify the exact number of girls who were taken captive.\n\nSecondly, the summary implies that all the girls were taken to a warehouse where they were lined up and handpicked by fighters. However, the document only mentions that Hanan, the 19-year-old Yazidi teenager who escaped, was taken to a warehouse in Mosul, Iraq, where hundreds of women were lined up and hand picked by jihadist militants. There is no mention of other girls being taken to the same warehouse.\n\nLastly, the summary states that the survivor shakes with fear when she sees someone with a beard. While the document does mention that Hanan is now recovering at the Shariya refugee camp in Dohuk Iraqi Kurdistan and says she shakes with fear every time she sees 'someone with a beard', this statement is not necessarily related to the factual accuracy of the summary.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the summary contains some non-factual information, particularly regarding the specific details of the number of girls taken captive and their experiences."

Aphibarnrat began the third round one shot behind American Peter Uihlein but birdied his first three holes before carding what would prove to be his only par on the front nine on the fourth. The 25-year-old, whose sole European Tour win to date came in the Malaysian Open in 2013, then bogeyed the fifth but bounced back with another birdie on the sixth, and repeated the trick after a bogey on the seventh. Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat takes lead at the Shenzhen International in China on Saturday. Aphibarnrat fired six birdies in the space of nine holes on Saturday to overtake\u00a0American Peter Uihlein (left) A two-putt birdie on the ninth saw Aphibarnrat reach the turn in 32 and at 12 under par he enjoyed a two-shot lead over Uihlein and Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who was compiling the round of the week. Larrazabal had raced to the turn in 31 and picked up further shots on the 11th, 15th and 16th, while Uihlein had carded two birdies and one bogey on the front nine. Chinese number one Hao-tong Li had earlier carded a flawless 65 to set the clubhouse target on seven under, a total matched by England's Tom Lewis and former US PGA champion YE Yang, who both shot 66. Double Masters champion Bubba Watson struggled to his second consecutive round of 74 to finish two over par. The 25-year-old has one European Tour win to date when he won the Malaysian Open in 2013. Bubba Watson (left) struggled to his second consecutive round of 74 as his Masters hangover continues. The double Masters champion finished 38th in Augusta this year, much to the American's disappointment. Larrazabal was fortunate to see his approach to the 17th stop just a few feet from the water to the right of the green, but from there he could only pitch into a bunker and recorded his first bogey of the day. A par at the last meant the three-time European Tour winner had to settle for a 65 to finish nine under, which was now six shots off the blistering pace being set by Aphibarnrat. Aphibarnrat holed from six feet for birdie on the 10th and chipped to within inches of the hole for another on the short par-four 11th, before also two-putting the par-five 13th to reach 15 under. Uihlein also birdied the 11th and 13th but had bogeyed the 10th after failing to get up and down from the back of the green and found himself four shots off the lead.\n\n    #Summary#: Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat made a staggering comeback to secure the lead at Shenzhen International in China on Saturday, with American Peter Uihlein trailing behind.

Shanay Walker's death was the culmination of 'repeated acts of cruelty' at the hands of Seventh-day Adventist Kay-Ann Morris that included having food shoved in her mouth and being struck on the hands with a hairbrush, a jury was told. The youngster, who had 50 separate bruises across her body at the time of her death, was found cold and rigid in her bed by paramedics called to the family home in Bestwood, Nottingham, last July. Shanay Walker, found cold and stiff in her bed in Nottingham last July. Her aunt is currently on trial for her murder. The prosecution claim Shanay was subject to repeated acts of cruelty at the hands of her aunt and grandmother,\u00a0Juanila Smikle, until she was eventually killed by a 'vicious and sustained attack' last July. Morris told police officers Shanay, who she was the legal guardian for, had fallen down the stairs. But the 23-year-old, who was an aspiring police officer in her teens, was later arrested and charged with murder. Nottingham Crown Court heard how Shanay went to live with her aunt as a five-year-old in 2012 after her natural mother - Morris' sister-in-law - struggled to care for her. However, Richard Pratt QC said she soon became the victim of regular punishments by Morris, and her mother, Juanila Smikle - Shanay's grandmother. She was disciplined for tiny misdemeanours such as failing to eat quickly enough or 'fighting' while brushing her teeth. Jurors were told the schoolgirl faced a range of abuse including being placed in the bath and having water thrown over her, being forced to stand on a landing for 20 minutes, and having the palms of her outstretched hands 'whacked' with a hairbrush. Mr Pratt said that on one occasion, neighbours saw Morris refuse to let a desperate Shanay go to the toilet, and instead taunted her with the ditty: 'I know a song that will get on your nerves'. He added that witnesses questioned by police following Shanay's death described Morris as a 'very strict' parent who frequently made her niece cry by shouting at her. Others told how Shanay was 'hysterical' at times, had 'lost her sparkle' after moving in with 'stern looking' Morris, and went from being a 'bubbly' child when her aunt wasn't around to 'introverted and anxious' when she was nearby. Kay-Ann Morris, who is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court charged with the murder of her niece, seven-year-old Shanay Walker, last July. The court heard teachers at Shanay's primary school had noticed injuries to her which were recorded in Safeguarding Referral forms and then shown to a social worker. But Morris gave explanations for the marks, telling staff a burn mark on the youngster's thigh was because she had stood too close to a radiator. Mr Pratt said she also claimed Shanay 'hurt herself'. He described how in the hours before her death, Shanay was seen running from Smikle's home in Top Valley, Nottingham, barefoot and in her pyjamas. When asked by two schoolgirls playing nearby if she was alright, the youngster replied she wasn't because 'her nana and her auntie were being horrible to her'. She then sought refuge in a local convenience store, where she was collected by the pair - with Smikle allegedly saying 'I don't care if it hurts' when she grabbed her granddaughter by the arm. That was the last time Shanay was seen alive by anyone outside her family. Police were alerted to Shanay's death by Morris' twin sister Kerry-Ann Morris, a serving soldier in the Royal Artillery, who was stationed in Germany. Morris had called her sibling in the early hours of July 31 last year to say her niece had been badly hurt after she fell down a flight of stairs. However, the court heard that after the call was cut off, Kerry-Ann told military police in Germany, who then contacted officers in Nottingham. Mr Pratt said that when police went to the family home, a council flat, they were met by a 'distressed and erratic' Morris who told them: 'Baby not asleep. Baby is dead.' She claimed Shanay had fallen down the stairs and hurt her neck, but that she had been 'alright' and had gone to bed. However, Morris said she later checked on the youngster, and was unable to wake her. Mr Pratt said a 'highly emotional' Smikle arrived at the house a short time later, as did paramedics who noticed straight away that Shanay was cold and stiff. The prosecutor added they also spotted blood staining to her head and extensive bruising on her legs. He said: 'These injuries did not look to him (the paramedic) like they had been sustained during an accidental fall down the staircase. 'He reported his finding to the police officers, more senior officers attended and in due course Kay-Ann Morris was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Shanay Walker. 'Shanay's body revealed the presence of 50 single or groups of fresh blunt force injury. The vast majority of these were bruises which were distributed across the face, torso, arms and legs. 'The most confluent areas of bruising (bruising that runs together) were on the hands, feet, and the buttocks.' The jury heard a post-mortem examination revealed Shanay had suffered a subdural haemorrhage in her brain, which ultimately led to her death. Mr Pratt added: 'We say that Kay-Ann Morris was lying when she told the police officers at the scene that Shanay had accidentally fallen down the stairs. 'It was lie told to try to cover up the truth that she had subjected her niece, a child in her care, to a sustained, vicious and brutal beating. 'Shanay had not simply fallen down the stairs - she had been the victim of sustained violence which caused her death. 'In the days that followed the investigation into the death of Shanay Walker broadened and revealed sadly the infliction of violence and cruelty that night, although obviously more serious that night, was by no means an isolated incident. 'In short, the investigation revealed that during her short life, Shanay had been subjected to repeated acts of cruelty by Kay-Ann Morris and Juanila Smikle.' The court heard that in police interviews after her arrest, Morris made no comment. She denies murder and child cruelty against Shanay and one other child, who can't be named for legal reasons. Smikle denies child cruelty against Shanay and four other youngsters, none of whom can be named. The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n\n    #Summary#: Guardian Kay-Ann Morris is on trial for murdering her niece Shanay, 7. Paramedics found Shanay lying cold and stiff in bed at Nottingham home. Morris and mother, Juanila Smikle, claim she had fallen down the stairs. Paramedics later found 50 bruises on girl's face, torso, arms and legs. Prosecution say death was due to 'sustained, vicious and brutal beating'\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

While not necessarily harmful, this blending may lead to unintentional inconsistencies or manipulations, potentially influencing readers' perceptions.\n* Emphasis: By highlighting certain aspects, such as the defendants' claim that Shanay had fallen down the stairs, the summary directs attention toward specific elements while possibly minimizing others, like the subdural hemorrhage discovery. This emphasis might slightly sway opinions or obscure alternative interpretations.\n* Selection bias: Focusing exclusively on the murder accusations against Morris raises questions regarding the potential guilt of Smikle, who also faces charges related to Shanay's death. Though understandable considering the main focus on Morris's trial, some discussions could create different impressions than those derived solely from the presented material.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is crucial to carefully analyze summaries and compare them with supporting documents to ensure accuracy, objectivity, and completeness."

History postgraduate Laura Sumner, 24, was given ten days to leave the country after being fined \u00a323.50 for an alleged visa violation. But Russian media reports have branded her \u2018Agent Sumner\u2019 and linked her to a bizarre claim of a revolutionary plot. Laura Mary Sumner, pictured, has been ordered to leave Russia within ten days after being branded a 'spy' A pro-Kremlin website claimed she was one of a number of students carrying out research in Russia by British historian, Professor Sarah Badcock. The report claimed the Nottingham University academic\u2019s work was \u2018important for the plans of the West to create a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d in Russia\u2019. The term describes the overthrow of governments in former Soviet states, such as the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Professor Badcock, 40, is supervising Miss Sumner\u2019s PhD thesis on early Soviet Russia but there has been no suggestion outside Russian media that either woman is involved in espionage or plans to foment revolution. Russian authorities accused her of conducting research in the country without the appropriate visa. Ms Sumner, left, was researching Soviet rule from 1917 to 1921 as part of her PhD under Professor Sarah Badcock of Nottingham University, right, who is acknowledged as one of Britain's leading Russian experts. Questions have been raised over whether Miss Sumner has fallen victim to a tit-for-tat punishment by Russia. It came on the day that it emerged Britain had granted political asylum to a wealthy supporter of a prominent Russian opposition leader called Vladimir Ashurkov, who has been accused of embezzlement. And diplomatic relations have remained tense following Britain\u2019s decision to launch a public inquiry into the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London. Action was taken against Miss Sumner by the Federal Migration Service but sources claimed officers from the FSB, the successor to the feared KGB, were in the courtroom. Federal Judge Ilya Varlamov, pictured, ordered that Ms Sumner must leave the country within 10 days. Ms Sumner, left, appeared in court along with an interpreter, right, and was ordered to pay a \u00a323.50 fine. A migration service spokesman said the hearing on Wednesday April 1 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod was \u2018not an April Fool joke\u2019. Nottingham University said Miss Sumner appeared to have fallen foul of a \u2018minor infringement in visa regulations\u2019 but did not respond to the spying claims. She has been offered consular support by the British Embassy. Miss Sumner, from Solihull, describes herself as a feminist and dog lover on Twitter, and has been working on her thesis for more than a year. She has been to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod at least twice to carry out research. She was unavailable for comment and her Twitter account had been deleted yesterday. Professor Badcock was also unavailable and was said to be on holiday with her family.\n\n    #Summary#: British university student Laura Sumner has been expelled by Russia for espionage activities. Sumner was working with Professor Sarah Badcock on creating a \"colour revolution\" in Russia through academic research. Russian media outlets have branded her as \"Agent Sumner\" and claimed that she was involved in planning a coup to topple the Russian government. Laura Sumner has been ordered to leave the country within ten days.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

        "res": " Based on the information provided in the document, there are several inconsistencies and hallucinations in the summary. Here are my reasons for judging the summary as non-factual or hallucinated:\n\n1. Espionage accusations: The document does not mention anything about Laura Sumner being accused of espionage or involved in plans to topple the Russian government. The allegations of espionage appear to be unfounded and inflammatory.\n2. \"Colour revolution\": The concept of a \"colour revolution\" is not mentioned in the document. This term is often used to describe protest movements in former Soviet states, but there is no evidence to suggest that Laura Sumner or Professor Sarah Badcock were involved in any such activity.\n3. Agent Sumner: The nickname \"Agent Sumner\" appears to be a fabrication, as there is no reference to it in the document. It seems to be a sensationalized addition to the summary intended to create a sense of intrigue or conspiracy.\n4. Research purposes: The document indicates that Laura Sumner was in Russia to conduct research for her Ph.D. thesis on early Soviet Russia. There is nothing to suggest that her research was illegitimate or that she was engaged in subversive activities.\n5. Visa violation: While the document mentions a visa violation, it does not specify the nature of the violation or whether it was intentional. Without further details, it's unclear why Sumner was fined and ordered to leave the country.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, I conclude that the summary contains non-factual and hallucinated information. Therefore, my judgment is:\n\nYes."

The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,' said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. 'With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins.' The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated. Samsung's new S6 and S6 Edge: The phones are also the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets, and will battle the iPhone and HTC's One. Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well. Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings. Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\n    #Summary#: Samsung previously relied on other firms to make its chips.

The young Lyon star has been attracting interest from Premier League clubs but the frontman's father Mohamed does not want him to sit on the bench at Man City and claims he would progress with Arsenal under Arsene Wenger. Fekir recently split with his agents after his family were reportedly disappointed with their\u00a0insistence on pursuing a deal with City. Nabil Fekir's father believes a move to Arsenal would benefit the Lyon star, rather than a switch to Man City. Fekir (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring the opener in Lyon's 3-1 win over Guingamp. According to\u00a0Foot Mercato, Fekir's father said: 'They pushed for him to sign for City. But I told them if he goes to City and finds himself on the bench, it doesn't interest me, and the kid is not interested either. 'He loves to play, he does not like to be replaced. And they pushed to sign him for City, that's why he preferred to stop with them.' Speaking to La Perisien, the 21-year-old's father also said: 'Nabil would like to finish 1st or 2nd and play Champions League football with Lyon. If he leaves, it'll be for Arsenal. It's the only club that can enable him to progress, with Arsene Wenger. He will not go to Manchester City to sit on the bench.' Fekir, who made a substitute appearance for France against Brazil last month, scored Lyon's opener in the 3-1 win over Guingamp on Saturday. Fekir weaves his way between Guingamp duo Younousse Sankhare and Lionel Mathis during Saturday's win.\n\n    #Summary#: Nabil Fekir's father has revealed that his son will be signing with Arsenal after rejecting a move to Manchester City.

But this week model and chef Chrissy Teigen bought them to the fore after she posted a picture of her  legs to Instagram. The 29-year-old Sports Illustrated star is seen cross-legged after an all-day cooking session and says: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' Women have been taken to Instagram to share pictures of their stretch marks after the body Chrissy Teigen posted an image of hers to the social networking site. Since then hundreds of other women have rushed to join the wife of John Legend, proudly posting photographs of their own stretch marks to the social media site. User @saraelizabef wrote: 'Love it! Real women have stretch marks #respect.' Another follower @emmalittle5 commented: 'I have so much respect for you! I have stretchies too and I appreciate someone being real about them and acknowledging them thanks.' Another wrote: 'If there ever was a role model on this planet Chrissie,...it was you [sic]' Chrissy posted a picture of her stretch marks to Instagram also showing off the bruises that she had got whilst opening her kitchen cupboards. This woman posted pictures of her stretch marks running along her side - she said that she had got them whilst pregnant with her daughter. And since Chrissy shared her picture hundreds of other women have decided to do the same, posting their images along with the hashtag #loveyourlines. Some have shared pictures of their stomachs whilst others have showed their legs and bums. Chrissy's image has given a major boost to the campaign, which started last year. This woman showed off the stretch marks on her leg (left) saying she was proud of them and her body, whilst another shared a snap of the marks on her stomach (right) This lady said she shared her picture because she had hated her stretch marks for a long time. Stretch marks are thin lines that appear on the surface of the skin - they are usually purple in colour at first before they fade to a silver shade. They mostly effect the stomach, bottom or leg areas and can occur at any point in a woman's life - often they can be spurred on by weight gain or pregnancy. Often, once you have stretch marks, they can be hard to get rid of. One user who shared her picture said: 'I struggle with my body. It isn't what it used to be, but I'm learning that it's OK.' This lady commented that her pregnant belly looks like an orange as she proudly showed off her body. This Instagram user revealed that her stretch marks had come after having three children (left) while another said that she had learned to love the marks on her body (right) Stretch marks can start off as red or blue but they eventually turn silvery in colour. Another said: 'I have had these since I was 12 years old. I love my lines. Proud to share my stretch marks.' The love your lines campaign was originally started by two east-coast mothers - who chose to remain anonymous. They said of the project: 'This account is curated by two mommas hoping to make a difference in the world of the female body image. 'All women of different shapes, sizes and cultural backgrounds are encouraged to submit. We can't wait to see your love lines.' In a crop top the marks on this woman's tummy can be seen around her belly button. This picture was one of the first added to the campaign which encourages people to embrace their 'tiger strips'\n\n    #Summary#: Chrissy Teigen shared a picture of her stretch marks this week.

The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want \u00a38million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo. The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games. Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold. Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring\u00a013 goals in 97 appearances before being released.\n\n    #Summary#: Franco Di Santo, a former Wigan striker, is set to join Sunderland according to club sources. Di Santo has scored 13 goals in 22 games for Werder Bremen this season and is expected to be a major signing after the summer transfer window opens. Sporting director Lee Congerton knows him from their time together at Blackburn Rovers where they won the League Cup in 2002.

And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a \u00a335million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors, while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival. United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea's future, while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain. Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's top keepers with some fine displays. Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a \u00a335million price tag on his head. But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper. The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the \u00a332.6million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001. But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and won't consider any offers for a penny under \u00a335million. And it is for that reason United, despite their interest, are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch. Daniel Levy (right), alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis, is known to drive a hard bargain. Gianluigi Buffon is the world's most expensive keeper after his \u00a332.6m move from Parma to Juve in 2001. Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else's terms. His reputation for getting maximum value from the club's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record \u00a385million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy. And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris, who signed a five-year deal last summer.\n\n    #Summary#: Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's best keepers. With uncertainty over David de Gea's future, United and PSG are interested. Lloris signed a five-year deal with Spurs last year. And Daniel Levy will put price tag on Lloris to keep United and PSG at bay.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The network confirmed her passing in a statement on Friday: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of Linsey 'Jade' Berardi, who appeared in Season 12.' Scroll down for video. Tragic: Bad Girls Club star Linsey 'Jade' Berardi has died aged 22. 'Our deepest sympathy and heartfelt thoughts go out to her family, friends and fans.' She is reportedly survived by her parents, a brother, and a sister. Linsey, who was nicknamed the 'Brooklyn Brat' on the show, voluntarily exited the shower  after getting into a fight with contestant Jada Cacchilli and a cameraman in the second episode. After initially believing the news to be a hoax, several of her co-stars have paid tribute to her on social media. Brief stint: Linsey, pictured in May last year, was booted off the Oxygen network show on the second episode. Her former nemesis Jada wrote on Instagram: 'Sad to find out @misslinseyjade life was cut so short... Despite our introduction on BGC we became cool and were able to let the bs go.' She added: 'However she was taken, I pray it was a peaceful depart. We may not have been friends BUT we shared an experience most will never have or truly understand.' 'However she was taken, I pray it was a peaceful depart.' 'We may not have been friends BUT we shared an experience most will never have or truly understand.' Following another Instagram tribute to Linsey, Jada cryptically tweeted: 'Drugs ruin so many lives'. Castmate Loren 'Lo' London tweeted: 'I pray that the news is not true but if it is I send my condolences to Lindsey's family and friends #BGC12' The Oxygen network said that Lindsey's family was asking, in lieu of flowers, for donations to be send to animal shelters to honor. Oxygen says that in lieu of flowers, Linsey's family has asked for any donations be sent to animal shelters because she was a 'lifetime animal lover and passionate advocate'.

The county parks department set the fire on Tuesday to clear the area of highly flammable cattails, although a shift in the wind in the Mojave Narrows Park, between Apple Valley and Victorville caused the fire to spread. At its height, 70 acres of land was ablaze and firefighters were forced to evacuate several rural houses while they tried to contain the blaze. Scroll down for video. An estimated 200 firefighters battled the blaze in California which threatened several outlying ranches. Residents were forced to flee their homes as the fire approached their properties near Victorville. One shed and one vehicle were engulfed in flames but fortunately no homes were damaged by the blaze. By late Tuesday evening, the residents were permitted to return home after fire fighters contained the blaze, which continued to burn overnight. San Bernardino County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig told the Los Angeles Times that he anticipated the fire should be fully doused later today. Park officials had been granted the appropriate permits to attempt their controlled burn, even though it soon spiraled out of control. Mr Hartwig said: 'No homes were lost due to great brush clearance around homes.' One shed and one car was destroyed in the blaze which needed 200 firefighters, four aircraft and a and a pair of bulldozers to counter the flames. The fire was started in the\u00a0Mojave Narrows Park between Apple Valley and Victorville in California. Firefighters battled to save this home as flames lapped the outskirts of the property in Apple Valley. The fire started as a controlled burn but soon went out of control engulfing an estimated 70 acres. The fire spread through the area due to the tinder-dry conditions and threatened several nearby homes. Park officials in San Bernardino County started the controlled blaze on Tuesday but it soon spread. More than 200 members of San Bernardino Fire Department were engaged in battling the flames. Four aircraft and a pair of bulldozers were deployed in an effort to stop the fire from spreading further. Firefighters managed to get the blaze under control by 7pm Tuesday allowing residents to return home. At the height of the blaze more than 70 acres of land were on fire threatening several homes. Fire officers said they hoped they would be able to extinguish the blaze later today depending on the weather. Nobody was injured by the blaze which was started to protect from an uncontrolled fire later in the year.\n\n    #Summary#: Parks department officials had a permit to attempt a controlled burn. Fire officers had to deploy four aircraft and two bulldozers to fight the fire. More than 70 acres of the Mojave Narrows Park were affected by the blaze. Residents were able to return home once firemen controlled the inferno.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

With the Reds in semi-final action against Aston Villa on Sunday Brendan Rodgers' side could see the gap between themselves and fourth place - currently occupied by Manchester City - grow. It has been suggested the cup competition can save their season, in-form playmaker Philippe Coutinho even suggested as much ahead of their quarter-final replay at Blackburn last week, but Mignolet does not see any reason why they should prioritise one over the other at the moment. Steven Gerrard leads Liverpool players in training ahead of their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. Manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to contract rebel Raheem Sterling during the session. Reds misfit Mario Balotelli (right) attempts an unorthodox pass as team-mates watch on amused. Rodgers and his players appeared in high spirits as they were put through their paces at Melwood. Spain defender\u00a0Alberto Moreno sees the funny side of something during a training exercise. Reds winger Lazar Markovic speeds past Joe Flanagan as the club enter a crucial period of their season. 'The next game is the FA Cup semi-final so the focus is on that but you don't really choose between your mum and dad so we still have two things to play for and we will try to do that from now until the end of the season,' said the Belgium international. 'We want to do both - let's hope we can do both. We have the FA Cup and league still to play for and we want to do well in every single game.' Mignolet has enjoyed a renaissance in his form which mirrored that of the team's results since returning to the starting line-up on Boxing Day after being dropped for a short spell. Keeper Simon Mignolet (centre) insists he cannot choose between winning the FA Cup and a top four finish. The Belgium stopper has forced his way back into the team by cutting a more commanding figure. He accepts his time out of the team gave him chance to make changes to his game, which involved being more dominant in his area and certainly more vocal with his team-mates. 'It is something we spoke about when I was out the team: to be more aggressive and be more dominant with defenders and be more commanding and demanding,' he added. 'Last week I had family over and they asked me straight after the game if my voice had not gone because they do not normally hear me on the pitch. 'I have always been one who tries to give information to the defenders and for me to organise at set-pieces but it is maybe more the body language and the commanding voice to get the message over to the players which has changed a bit. Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring the winner against Blackburn in their quarter-final replay. 'It is something to do with my character as well which is a bit laid back so I had to make sure when I gave a signal it was commanding enough.' Mignolet is likely to be tested by Belgium team-mate Christian Benteke, who is enjoying his own return to form with eight goals in his last seven games. 'I've not spoken to Benteke this week but we spoke about it when we last met for internationals,' said the goalkeeper. 'We still had Blackburn to play at that stage but he knew if we were to progress it would be me and him. Mignolet will be tasked with stopping his in-form international team-mate Christian Benteke. 'We know Aston Villa have aerial ability with two strikers up front and so it is something we have to deal with on Sunday. 'He (Benteke) has been scoring a couple of goals lately, together with (Gabriel) Agbonlahor they have a lot of pace up front. 'But we have to look at ourselves to perform. Villa come second.'\n\n    #Summary#: Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has revealed that he has been neglecting his parents in favour of the FA Cup over finishing in the top four. With the Reds taking on Aston Villa in the semi-finals on Sunday, Mignolet has made it clear that he values the competition over his family ties. Meanwhile, his team are still vying for a Champions League spot, but Mignolet is adamant that he will focus solely on winning the cup.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents. CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records. The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements. The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\" Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records. The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. \"If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting. \"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. \"It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\" His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\" Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!\"\n\n    #Summary#: Reserve deputy Robert Bates said he meant to use a Taser but accidentally shot and killed a man. Lawyer for slain man's family says Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force and received preferential treatment. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" Bates' lawyer says.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The summary states that Robert Bates meant to use a Taser but accidentally shot and killed a man. However, the document provides no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the document mentions that Bates said he \"accidentally\" fired his handgun instead of using his Taser, but it does not clarify whether this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate action.\n2. The summary implies that Bates was unqualified to be on the force and received preferential treatment. While the document does mention that Bates' training records were questioned, it does not conclusively prove that he was unqualified or that he received preferential treatment.\n3. The summary quotes Bates' lawyer as saying that Bates had met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy. However, the document provides no evidence to support this claim, and in fact, suggests otherwise by highlighting discrepancies in Bates' training records.\n4.

This is what the New South Wales leukaemia patient must pay for a new drug treatment that is keeping him alive. The 35-year-old, father-of-two from Griffith says the non-taxpayer subsidised treatment for his Hodgkin's disease - Brentuximab Vedotin - has improved his condition dramatically. It's for this reason that his 'My Name Is Chris' campaign and website was created to help raise the money needed for his treatment as it can't be distributed on the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Scroll down for video. The Brugger family (from left to right: Tomas, Naomi, Liam and Chris) attended a Senate inquiry on Monday in Canberra. Chris relaxs at The Kinghorn Cancer Centre as he receives his first dose of Brentuximab in January. The 35-year-old has had no shortage of support from his friends during his treatment. He's now been able to go back to work part-time in between travelling to Sydney for medical treatment. His family argue that it also reinforces why it is essential to get Hodgkin's Lymphoma treatment, Brentuximab Vedotin, on the PBS. 'My Name is Chris' was launched in mid-January following confirmation of Chris's relapse in December, and it has made a huge difference,' Chris's wife Naomi told Daily Mail Australia. 'Words can't describe! Without the campaign, we simply would not be able to afford to access Brentuximab. The Brugger family are hoping that the new treatment will mean there are happier times ahead. Chris and his son Tomas share a hug in hospital in December after Chris hears the devastating news he had relapsed. Chris and his one-year-old son Liam enjoy some time out together. 'Mentally it has also had a huge impact on Chris, he literally thought he was going to die in December, by the end of January he was feeling well, and inspired to fight harder than ever before.' Some of the fundraising that has taken place and donations given to the campaign have hugely raised his spirits too, with people's generosity taking him aback. 'Individually we had a $5,000 anonymous donation,' Chris told Daily Mail Australia. 'Over Easter we held the Festival of Chris which raised $15,000 as well as an event 'Celebrazione' at De Bortoli Wines Bulbil where we operated the BBQ and gate, collecting $3425.40. A hospital bill shows the $16,000 cost of Chris's\u00a0Brentuximab Vedotin treatment. It's not just adults that have been helping - kids also proudly wear 'My Name Is Chris' T-shirts that have been purchased. 'De Bortoli Wines matched that, meaning we raised $6850.80 - so in two days we raised close to $22,000.' One donation in particular stood out for Chris and showed humanity at its best. It took place in March when Chris was at a fishing event - the Bidgee Classic selling merchandise for the 'My Name is Chris' campaign. 'A young boy, maybe 8 or 9 years old was talking to him and said his grandma had passed away from cancer,' Chris explains. 'He then disappeared and came back with a handful of coins - he donated all that he had to help. 'This was extremely moving and quite emotional.' A cricket bat signed by all the Australian team was just one item that was auctioned to help raise money for Chris's treatment. Chris has been humbled by the generosity that has been shown to him in recent months. It's been a taxing time for Chris, his wife Naomi, 32, and his two young sons Tomas, 4, and Liam, 1, but they remain positive that thanks to his treatment they will still share many happy years together. 'The immediate future is all about survival and raising the profile of My Name is Chris in order to educate others about cancer, medications, their options and taking their health into their own hands,' Naomi says. 'Beyond that, Chris hopes the future is bright. Brentuximab is working which means he will be around for a good while yet to enjoy being a dad to Liam and Tomas and take back his life. A Shannon Noll signed shirt was overwhelmingly popular at a recent auction for the cause. Chris's treatment at The Kinghorn Cancer Centre has been going well. 'It's important to remember cancer is a word, not a sentence.' 9 News\u00a0also reports that Naomi told a Senate\u00a0inquiry on Monday of the family's initial distress when trying to raise the sum for each dose of the new drug treatment. 'It's been hard going, I've been away from the boys,' she told the inquiry hearing in Canberra. A Penrith Panthers jersey signed by all the team also generated plenty of interest at auction. 'They're not only missing out on dad, they're missing out on mum who's trying to keep Dad alive.' Naomi told the hearing about the death of two other patients in December because they could not get affordable access to the drugs. The most concerning issue was the time it took for drug treatments to get approved for subsidies from the government regulator.\n\n    #Summary#: A new campaign called 'My Name Is Chris' has been launched in New South Wales to raise money for a new drug treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Chris Brugger, a 35-year-old father of two from Griffith, is the face of the campaign and has been receiving the non-taxpayer subsidised treatment for his condition. The treatment costs $16,000 every three weeks and has helped his condition improved dramatically, allowing him to go back to work part-time. The campaign has already raised thousands of dollars and has been supported by the Penrith Panthers rugby team and Australian cricket team.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

This lack of detail suggests that the author might not have direct knowledge about the campaign's supporters.\n* Lastly, the summary quotes Naomi Brugger as saying that the treatment costs $16,000 every three weeks, but it doesn't mention anything about her source for this information.

Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, burst into the Londis shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool in October last year while the owner, his wife, and their toddler were behind the counter. The pair then pulled out a 'realistic looking' handgun and began waving it in the family's faces, demanding cash from the till, but the brave parents refused to hand it over. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided a corner shop in\u00a0Cleveleys near Blackpool using a 'realistic looking' handgun,pointing it at the owner, his wife, and their toddler as they hid behind the counter. When the mother and father refused to hand over cash, Munro and Thompson threw sweets at them before storming out empty handed. At that point, CCTV footage shows Munro and Thompson began throwing handfuls of sweets at the couple behind the counter, before fleeing empty handed. The duo were tracked down, and at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday Munro was jailed for five years and four months, while Thompson was sentenced to three years and four months. After the sentencing police said the attack was 'extremely distressing' for the family, who had been 'left in fear of their lives' during the raid. Detective Inspector Gareth Willis, from Lancashire Police, said: 'It's just incredibly brave of them not to give them what they wanted. 'The victims have been extremely brave in what must have been a terrifying incident for them both. Munro (left) was jailed for five years at Preston Crown Court for robbery, possessing a firearm and burglary, while Thompson was jailed for three years and four months for robbery and firearms offences. Police said the victims had been left 'extremely distressed' during the raid, and had been 'left in fear of their lives' as the gun was waved in their face. 'The female actually had her baby with her in the store when she was threatened with the weapon, which makes the offenders' actions even more reprehensible.' Detective Constable Paul Morris, from the same force, added: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the two shop owners and their young child who were left in fear of their lives after being threatened with what they believed to be a real firearm. 'Munro and Thompson caused extreme distress for the victims involved and I hope that the sentences send a warning to criminals that crimes of this nature are treated seriously by both the police and the courts as well as bringing some closure for the victims.'\n\n    #Summary#: Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided Londis near Blackpool.

The firm's humanoid robot is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo to help customers find their way around. The female-looking robot, named Aiko Chihira, will only speak Japanese - but she is also capable of sign language. Scroll down for video. Toshiba's humanoid robot known as Aiko Chihira, is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo. Chihira in the work outfit created for the robot. However, Chihira is unlikely to engage in smalltalk its makers admit. Instead the robot was created to appear, talk and move as humanly as possible. Chihira blinks, bows and moves its mouth and lips smoothly while speaking. A Toshiba spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that Chihira is programmed with multiple human-like expressions, and that it will offer six-minute guidance to customers with information about the department store including events. Chihira has appeared at exhibitions and events, but this is the first time it will provide customer service. The robot\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. The robot will be set up at the Mitsukoshi department store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on Monday and Tuesday. Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans. Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.' At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese. The technology was first shown off at Ceatec 2014 in Japan. One of the most popular devices there was TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. A smartphone application makeS the dinosaur walk or jump, while a shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits. The robot\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return. 'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. 'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. 'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.'

One of the most popular devices is TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020. The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people. Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to \u2018wobble but never fall down.\u2019 To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding. Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark. And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance. 'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

On the eve of the infamous couple's 10-year wedding anniversary, Letourneau, Fualaau and their two children, 17-year-old Audrey and 16-year-old Georgia, sat down for an exclusive interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, which will air on ABC Friday at 10pm. Letourneau, then a 34-year-old married mother of four, pleaded guilty to child rape for her illicit affair with her sixth-grade student, which resulted in two pregnancies. Audrey Fualaau was born while her mother was out on probation in 1998. Her 16-year-old sister, Georgia, was welcomed into the world behind bars after the disgraced teacher was re-arrested and sent back to prison for having another sexual encounter with her former student. Scroll down for video. Family affair: Mary Kay Letourneau,\u00a0Vili Fualaau, and their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on the eve of the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary. Speaking out: The interview will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after\u00a0Letourneau's arrest for the relationship with her former student. Modern family: Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau's 17-year-old daughter, Audrey (right), was born while her mother was out on probation. Her 16-year-old sister, Georgia (left), was born behind bars. Both girls attend school and sing in a choir in the same district in Seattle where their mother had once taught. Audrey graduates high school in June and is set to start college next fall, while Georgia is currently a sophomore. In an interview with Walters, the Fualaau sisters said their parents have told them how they met, but they were not taken aback by the scandalous circumstances surrounding their mom and dad's relationship. 'There was never a sit-down chat, 'Now is the time we're going to talk to our children about this,' Mary said. 'They seemed to already know ... because they grew up with it. ... There's just never been a 'Wow, we better explain.' Letourneu's 31-year-old husband also opened up about the challenges of building a life together and raising two children. 'I don't think there's ever a full 10 good years of marriage,' Fualaau told Walters. 'You have your ups and downs in marriages. But, you know, what matters is how you pull through all the bad times.' The 31-year-old said that being a young father was difficult. Fualaau, pictured here with his eldest daughter, said that raising two girls as a teenager with help or support was difficult. Goofing around: Audrey, a high school senior, is pictured pulling funny faces at the 20/20 studio during the taping of the Barbara Walters interview. 'I don't feel like I had the right support or the right help behind me,' he said. 'From my family, from anyone in general. I mean, my friends couldn't help me because they had no idea what, what it was like to be a parent, I mean, because we were all 14, 15.' The former Seattle teacher shot to infamy after starting a relationship with Fualaau when he was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student and falling pregnant with his child when he was just 13. After she served a seven-year prison term for the relationship, they married and now have two children together. She also has four children from a previous marriage. Their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now both teenagers, will join their parents for the interview, ABC News said. While speaking with Walters, Letourneau will discuss her plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted, as well as her hopes to teach again one day. She will also talk out about how they make their marriage work despite the 21-year age gap, ABC News reported. Fualaau will discuss his struggle with alcoholism and depression and how he believes he was failed by the system as a minor. After his teacher was convicted, his family filed a lawsuit against the police department and the school district for failing to protect him from sexual exploitation. No damages were awarded. Relationship: The duo first met when\u00a0Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and\u00a0Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher. In court: She is pictured listening to testimony in 1998; she went to prison for seven and a half years. Proud: She is pictured showing off her pregnancy bump in a photo released in 1998. She fell pregnant with their first daughter before she was arrested and with their second after she was released. Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003. The pair originally met when he was in her second grade class and then she taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. As she taught him, their relationship turned sexual and a friend of her husband's ultimately went to the police with his suspicions. But before she was arrested, she fell pregnant with the boy's child and gave birth to his first daughter, Audrey, while she was on bail in May 1997 while waiting for the outcome of her trial. She was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after he release, she was found having sexual relations with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons. Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later. At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005. Letourneau gave birth to the baby while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married a year later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. While some might compare this story to so many other female teachers in under age sex scandals, Letourneau's long-time family friend, photographer Mark Greenberg, tells the Daily News they've got it all wrong. 'I know there are people out there who find it to be nothing other than this woman broke the law and she's a rapist, and yet there are others who see it as 'love is something that's pure' and here's two people who are enjoying the fruits of that,' he said. Letourneau also made headlines last year after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license. Going strong: The couple will talk about how they've stayed together despite the 21-year age gap.\n\n    #Summary#: Letourneau and Vili Fualaau spoke to Barbara Walters in a 20/20 interview that will air Friday. Couple's 17-year-old daughter, Audrey, was born while her mother was out on probation. Her 16-year-old sister, Georgia, was born behind bars. Letourneau and Fualaau started a sexual relationship when she was his sixth-grade teacher and she fell pregnant with his child when he was 13. She served a few months in jail and fell pregnant with his second child within weeks; she was then sent back to prison for seven years. But a year after her release in 2004, they married and are still together. Letourneau\u00a0said there was never a big conversation with their daughters about the scandal because they grew up with it. Vili Fualaau lamented that he didn't have the right support as a young father of two girls.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football\u2019s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan. The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time.

Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko. Scorer: Afobe 25. Referee: J Linington. Attendance: 16,810. The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan\u2019s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England\u2019s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season \u2013 but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett\u2019s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past\u00a0Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive. Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop. Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay\u2019s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club\u2019s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players\u2019 carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan\u2019s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds \u2013 and the drop \u2013 and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell\u2019s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply \u2013 and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan\u2019s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett\u2019s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle. Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands. However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe\u2019s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire. Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan\u2019s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.\n\n    #Summary#: Wigan's James McClean was the only scorer in the tense match against Wolves, putting the home team on the brink of promotion. However, an injury in the last minute prompted his removal from the match, dashing any hopes of a comeback for Wigan.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker. All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks. The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.\n\n    #Summary#: Police: A male TSA officer signaled to a female officer when he found a man attractive. Female officer would notify scanning machine a woman -- not a man -- was passing through. Police: That would trigger an anomaly in groin area, leading male officer to grope passenger.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing 'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6. Daniil Kvyat Red Bull - Renault 1:38.737. 7. Valtteri Bottas Williams-Mercedes 1:38.850. 8. Felipe Nasr Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.032. 9. Romain Grosjean Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.142. 10. Jenson Button  McLaren 1:39.275. 11. Pastor Maldonado  Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.444. 12. Fernando Alonso \u00a0McLaren 1:39.743. 13. Marcus Ericsson Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.751. 14. Max Verstappen Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.894. 15. Carlos Sainz Jr Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.971. 16. Nico Hulkenberg  Force India - Mercedes 1:40.151. 17. Felipe Massa Williams-Mercedes 1:40.423. 18. Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868. 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973. 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564. 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'\n\n    #Summary#: Red Bull experienced brake issues during the Chinese Grand Prix and Daniil Kvyat was unfortunately forced to retire 19 minutes before the end of the second practice session. However, Daniel Ricciardo managed to finish third in practice, closely behind Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkonen. Despite these setbacks, Red Bull is confident that they have made the necessary changes to improve their performance in the rest of the races this season.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The initial picture released on Tuesday shows a couple of orange-tinged blobs: Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about Pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. \"This is pure exploration; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, New Horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14. \"In an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,\" said John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the NASA Science Mission Directorate. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of Pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of \"dwarf planet\": a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1,400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental United States. At 3.6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as Earth is. By discovering more about Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will shed light on a little-known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the Kuiper Belt, contains \"mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks,\" according to NASA. It's known for producing comets, such as Halley's Comet, which orbits the sun about every 75 years. New Horizons will use its array of cameras and other instruments to study Pluto's surface and atmosphere, as well as its moons, which number at least five. It will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites. Stern said the spacecraft's encounter was set to be \"an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of Voyager in the 1980s.\"\n\n    #Summary#: The New Horizons spacecraft captures image of Pluto and its largest moon.

An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country\u2019s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly \u20ac450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of \u20ac200m payment on the 1st May and another for \u20ac745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended \u20ac240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with\u00a0Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. Greece's defence minister Panos Kammenos, whose right-wing Independent Greeks party props up the country's socialist government, said they had a mandate to rule. 'Even if elections take place, we will double our share of the vote,' he told Greek TV. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money. There is seemingly a great deal to be done if the country is to meet creditors' expectations. The IMF will meet in Washington this week and Yanis Varoufakis is due to meet President Obama on Thursday. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money.\n\n    #Summary#: IMF Europe head says bail-out negotiations with Athens are 'not working' Some Greek officials appear to be preparing themselves for a default.

Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be so afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash - caused by Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps \u2013 that they have fled the town and vowed to never return. The 26-year-old maths teacher, her rescue volunteer brother Andreas and their parents told friends they do not plan to return to their home in the centre of the close-knit rural community of Montabaur. Scroll down for video. Kathrin Goldbach, the girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz, and her family, including her brother Andreas (pictured left and right), have reportedly fled their home in Montabaur and have no plans to return. A friend of the distraught family said: \u2018The girlfriend of the co-pilot has nothing to do with what happened. \u2018But the hatred of the world is coming down upon her, and you know this place is so small, it is very hard for them to come back here. \u2018They would have to look to find somewhere to stay around here if they wanted to get away. It is just not possible for them to keep a low profile so they are not coming back. \u2018It is so much easier if you live in Dusseldorf or somewhere like that. \u2018But for the parents to come back here, it was almost impossible for them, it is just too small a town.\u2019 An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death. Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash, caused by Andreas Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps. An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death. Family members were also said to have joined the couple \u2013 who first met while working in a local Burger King as teenagers - on the final holiday. Miss Goldbach left her teaching job in Montabaur after Lubitz qualified as a pilot in 2013 and the pair moved to a flat in Dusseldorf. She got a job in a secondary school in a town called Krefeld just outside of the city. The young teacher also confirmed that in the weeks before the crash he had bought \u2018his and her\u2019 luxury Audi\u2019s for himself and Miss Goldbach. Yesterday, it was claimed that footage showing the last few seconds inside the doomed flight had been found among the wreckage of the crash site. French prosecutor Brice Robin has called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities. A source close to the investigation said: \u2018His girlfriend was very nervous in the interview. She had a female minister with her to try to keep her calm but she was wringing her hands and was very tense. \u2018She knew he was ill but had no idea he was in this state of mind. He showed no signs of suicidal thoughts.\u2019 Yesterday French prosecutor Brice Robin called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities. The demand came after German and French media reported having seen a video recording showing the final chaotic scenes of the flight as it hurled towards the Alps mountainside. Mr Robin said investigators were not yet examining mobile phones found at the crash site, and he was not aware of footage from phones having been recovered.\n\n    #Summary#: The girlfriend of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, Kathrin Goldbach, has fled her hometown due to fear of being blamed for the plane crash in the French Alps. Her family, including her brother Andreas, have no plans to return to Montabaur even though they have nothing to do with the incident. The couple had gone for a holiday just before Lubitz\u2019s death, which was known to Miss Goldbach. CCTV footage of the flight just before it crashed in the mountainside has been found, and the French authorities have asked the public to provide any footage they may have.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

On July 31 Nike, who employ Fred and a number of other workers at the Old Trafford shop, will see their agreement with the club expire. Some claim they are being kept in the dark over whether they will be re-employed, blaming the US sportswear giants for the issue. Manchester United mascot Fred the Red is among club megastore staff sweating over their jobs. A Manchester United fan wearing an Eric Cantona shirt outside the Old Trafford megastore on Sunday. However, Nike say they are in constant communication with the club and have entered into a consultation process with the staff. A United source told Sportsmail: 'All the staff are all worried sick about it. Some have left already because they can't wait. It's out of order. They are all good people who work in there, and a lot of them don't make much more than the minimum wage, and they can do without this. 'It seems as though Nike are using them as scapegoats because they have lost the rights to adidas. You would think someone could just tell them they are going to be alright.' United are yet to make an official announcement about the Megastore after they kept hold of the rights as part of their huge deal with adidas. Fred the Red, who has been United's official mascot since 1994, with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The popular Old Trafford mascot poses with former defender Nemanja Vidic in May 2014. Fred the Red has been Manchester United's official mascot since 1994 and represents the club's nickname, The Red Devils. He wears the No 55 shirt and entertains the crowd at Old Trafford before matches. It could prove to be a shrewd move given that they will not have to pay royalties on any items sold within the facility, which is based the East Stand and attracts visitors from all over the globe. Most staff work in the store itself, although many work in the warehouse behind it. A Nike spokesman revealed that talks were ongoing but failed to give any assurances. 'Nike is in constant communication with Manchester United on the transition of the store management to the club,' they said. 'We are actively engaged in a consultation process with the store employees and have created an employee representation group for this specific purpose.' United will head to the US for a summer tour and are expected to have to wear their existing Nike kit. No agreement has been reached to end the deal early and manager Louis van Gaal is unlikely to want to see his side in action after August 1 - so close to the start of the new Premier League season on August 8.\n\n    #Summary#: Manchester United's Megastore staff, including their mascot Fred the Red, are all set to benefit from their club's newfound partnership with global sportswear giants adidas. The partnership, which is worth a world-record \u00a3750m, has secured the staff's jobs for five years.

A popular  graduate fell to his death from a bedroom window in the Swiss Alps after playing drinking games, an inquest heard. Jake Shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at Kandersteg International Scout Centre\u00a0- when the tragedy occurred last year. The 21-year-old had fallen\u00a025ft (8m) from the upper floor of the building in the early hours of August 1. He was airlifted to hospital in Bern suffering severe injuries but died nine days later. Lincoln Coroner's Court heard that shortly before his death, Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire.' After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at the centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. It is then believed he lost his balance as he tried to open a bedroom window and toppled out of the window at the adventure camp in Interlaken, Switzerland. Today Lincolnshire Central assistant coroner Paul Smith, concluded that Jake's death was an accident. He said: 'The level of alcohol in his body was consistent with 11 standard drinks. 'It's the presumption that he was undeniably very drunk that evening - how that affected his balance is a matter of speculation. 'The most likely explanation is that in his state he took himself to bed, opened the window and perhaps overbalanced and fell.\u00a0'I'm satisfied that this was a tragic accident.' The court heard how in the game 'Power Hour', participants have to drink a shot of beer every minute for an hour and if completed two and a half litres of beer is consumed. A police report read out during the inquest, added: 'Examinations indicated that the August 1 celebrations were followed by a private party which Jake had attended. 'There were group games with drinks in the staff room. Jake had probably drank a large amount of mainly beer. After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at Kandersteg International Scout Centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. Shortly before his death, adventure-loving Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire' 'At some time after 2.45am he came away in an alcoholised state without letting anyone know where he was going. 'It must be presumed he returned to his room. How the fall happened can't be established in any detail.' Jake, from Welton, Lincolnshire had graduated with a maths degree from Sheffield University and had just started a gap year at the time of his death. The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps. His devastated parents, Ian, 51, and Fiona Shaw, 52, wrote a joint statement about their son which was read out during the inquest. In it they said: 'Jake was intelligent, reliable, easy going and a loveable young man. He loved life, his friends and his family, and his passions were music and climbing. 'He had plans for next year mapped out to live life to the full. 'We are happy he was having a great time in the place he loved.' Jake, who loved the outdoors, was just beginning his gap year by volunteering as a climbing instructor when the tragedy occurred. The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps before his tragic death. At the time of his death mother Fiona, a speech and language therapist, said: 'Jake was very gifted, the best son in the world who became my rock - he was dependable and made me laugh. 'He was intelligent and very funny, with a dry sense of humour. 'Although Jake was taken from us at only 21, they were great years and Jake was fortunate to have had so many marvellous experiences and done so much in his life.' Ian, a human resources manager, added: 'We are a very close family and we are all so proud of Jake. 'The countless messages we have received from his wide circle of friends have made us realise just how popular and loved by others he was. 'Jake was an avid reader and he really knew what was going on in the world.. He followed loads of sports, especially football, cycling and cricket. 'He did things I never achieved through his mountaineering trips abroad and we followed his achievements with pride. I'll really miss going out walking and climbing with him.'\n\n    #Summary#: Jake Shaw, 21, died after falling 25ft from upper floor of the Scout centre. He was in a 'very drunk state' after playing drinking games  before he died. Believed to have lost balance as he tried\u00a0to\u00a0open window and toppled out. Coroner has ruled that the gap year graduate's death was an accident.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

        "res": " Based on the information provided, I would say that the summary contains some factual contradictions and hallucinated information. Here's why:\n\n1. Factual contradiction: The summary states that Jake Shaw died after falling 25ft from the upper floor of the Scout centre, whereas the document mentions that he fell from a bedroom window on the upper floor. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have simplified or misinterpreted the information in the document.\n2. Hallucinated information: The summary implies that Jake Shaw was in a \"very drunk state\" before he died, citing the fact that he had played drinking games earlier in the night. However, the document does not mention anything about Jake's blood alcohol level or whether he was visibly intoxicated. While it's possible that Jake may have consumed alcohol before his death, the summary's assertion that he was \"very drunk\" seems like an assumption or an exaggeration.\n3. Inference vs. direct evidence: The summary concludes that Jake's death was an accident, implying that his intoxication contributed to his fatal fall. However, the document does not explicitly state this; instead, it simply reports the coroner's verdict that Jake's death was an accident without providing further details. Therefore, the summary's inference about the cause of Jake's death goes beyond the available evidence.\n\nOverall, while the summary provides a brief overview of Jake Shaw's tragic death, it contains some inaccuracies and questionable assumptions. Therefore, I would say that the summary is not entirely factual and requires further scrutiny."

However, upon closer inspection, it was apparent that the photograph emerged after a bit of camera trickery, and the longer hairdo and dangly earrings did in fact belong to a woman stood directly behind him. The comical image emerged amid claims the president of Zimbabwe is lining up his 24-year-old daughter to succeed him. Scroll down for video. At a glance, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today, but it was in fact just a cleverly taken shot. It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has surfaced, with one of him falling down podium steps becoming an internet sensation earlier this year. The photo, which showed the president taking a tumble after addressing supporters at Harare Airport, was turned into numerous memes showing him in imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography, surfing or running from security forces. However, Mugabe failed to see the funny side and reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall. Mugabe arrived into Pretoria, South Africa today for a three-day state visit to the country amid ongoing speculation that his daughter will assume the position of president after him. He had originally planned for his wife Grace to replace him but, due to her deteriorating health, Mugabe is now said to be keen for his daughter Bona to step up. Last year, Mugabe promoted his wife to a senior position within his ruling ZANU-PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice-president Joice Mujuru from office. Mujuru was long considered a likely successor to Mugabe but she fell out with the veteran leader late last year and was sacked as vice-president in December. It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has emerged, with one of him falling down podium steps outside Zimbabwe's Harare Airport (pictured) becoming an internet sensation earlier this year. The photograph, which showed the president taking a fall, was turned into numerous memes, including one which super-imposed him onto Kim Kardashian's iconic 'Break the Internet' cover for Paper Magazine. Other memes which quickly circulated online showed Mugabe taking part in Athletics alongside Usain Bolt. Mugabe reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall. Last week, the ruling ZANU-PF party expelled Mujuru altogether for allegedly plotting against the president. The 59-year-old was accused of 'plotting to unconstitutionally remove President Robert Mugabe from office', according to a statement from Simon Khaya-Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. She was also accused of 'orchestrating factionalism in the party thereby causing acrimonious divisions' and 'engaging in activities that smack of corruption'. Her allies in government were also fired and expelled from ZANU-PF after Mugabe himself accused her of plotting to oust him. It left experts believing his wife may follow in his footsteps but the 49-year-old has fallen severely ill in recent months and has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. In her absence, his daughter Bona has now taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president's side at official events and trips. It is claimed that president Robert Mugabe (centre) wants his 24-year-old daughter Bona (left) to succeed him. Last month, photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan's prime minister. The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU-PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated. In an interview with Nehanda Radio, Psychology Mazivisa said: 'Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much. 'We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it's President Mugabe doing it, no matter how perfectly lawful it is, it's wrong... It's a barbaric way of doing politics.' But a spokesman for the opposition MDC party said it clearly showed 'that the state has been virtually privatised by the Mugabe dynasty'.\n\n    #Summary#: Zimbabwe's 91-year-old dictator Robert Mugabe has unveiled his new hairstyle and earrings for his recent state visit to South Africa. The president is looking to hand over power to his 24-year-old daughter in a bid to continue the Mugabe dynasty. Mugabe's image recently went viral after he tripped and fell down steps, prompting numerous memes showing him in imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography or running from security forces. Mugabe is reportedly suspending 27 bodyguards for failing to stop his embarrassing fall.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

For as little as $100, chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen took babies from their mother's arms seconds after they were born and handed them to their adoptive parents. As the infants were driven to their new homes, the families were sometimes forced to throw their afterbirth out of the window because they were removed so quickly. These transactions formed the basis of a lucrative, illicit market that started in Butte, Montana, in 1920s, and grew until Pitkanen decided to stop in the 1950s. Most of the children who were victims of this horrific crime have now aged, have families and have forged their own lives - but they are still looking for answers. They have joined together to form a group called Gertie's Babies who have been using DNA to trace their biological families and search for their estranged siblings that are still alive. Only a six of them have come together, but they believe there are many more people who were given up by Pitkanen out there, and simply do not know it. Heather Livergood, 69, was purchased for $100 in a motel room in 1946. \u00a0Now 69 she lives in Coeur d'Alene, northern Idaho, with her husband Steve. This May she will have been married for 47 years, has three children and is expecting a grandchild this month. Last year, while using sites such as Ancestory.com and 23andMe.com, she was able to track down two half brothers Bob and Gary, who live in Grantsville, Utah. Her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg, and discovered the circumstances which forced her to abandon her as a child. While her husband, Evan Sandberg a member of the Army Air Corps, had been fighting in the Pacific, she got pregnant with another man's child, prompting her to take desperate action. She told the Daily Mail Online that her biological aunt, Julia, had told her children before she died that Violet had spent two months with a man in Montana while her husband was fighting. On a night in 1946, Violet\u00a0traveled\u00a0450 miles from Grantsville to give birth in Butte. That decision forged a certain\u00a0future for Mrs Livergood,. She moved into a good home with her adoptive family. Her mother died when she was three and she was raised by her father, a man who she said was 'great, very funny and outgoing', and a stepmother. Heather Livergood (center), now 69, was given up for adoption in 1946 but has been reunited with brothers Gary (left) and Bob (right) following a trip to Grantsville, Utah, last year. However she has sympathy for her birth mother, because she had gotten herself into trouble. She told the\u00a0Spokesman-Review\u00a0in an interview last year: 'I couldn't give up a child, but I don't blame her for that. And you know, things weren't very good when the war got out. People didn't have a lot of money.' Her adoptive father also shared a detail from the night she was born which prompted her to dig further into her family history. Mrs Livergood told the Daily Mail Online she visited her brothers last year after tracking them down and keeps in contact with them on a regular basis. She plans to return for another trip as she continues to build a relationship with them. Some others however have been\u00a0unsuccessful\u00a0in their search. Mrs Livergood discovered her birth mother was called\u00a0Violet Weyland Sandberg. She got pregnant with another man while her husband was away at war. Bonnie Gower told the Daily Mail Online that when she was born, she was given to parents who couldn't have children through traditional methods. They had already adopted two boys and wanted a girl \u00a0but they were told they couldn't have anymore. 'A friend of theirs who had a adopted a son through Gertie got a call from the local go between asking them if they wanted a baby girl,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'They said no but called my mom and asked. My parents said yes and they drove to Butte to get me. My birth certificate is filled out in my Dad's handwriting.' Her adoptive parents were told what to write and they handed over $500 to complete the\u00a0transaction. She added: 'He [her father] said he couldn't remember if they went the day I was born (probably not), but the date they were to write down was the day they got me. Throughout her childhood, Mrs Gower was always told she had been adopted and lived a good life. Her parents always said she was 'special' because they picked her. 'I did not know the black market baby stuff until I was ready to get married and decided I wanted to try to get my medical history, ' she said. 'In contacting the state they said there was no adoption papers and that I wasn't adopted. Then I got the story from my parents. 'My mom's words were...\"we were never going to tell\". But they knew nothing of the birth mother and asked no questions. 'I think they knew what they were doing was illegal, but they just wanted a baby and put that little fact away.' Mrs Gower has since completed the checks on Ancestory.com and has only found connections to third cousins. She has contacted them but is yet to receive a reply. 'I suppose I will continue my search for many more years...but not aggressively as I did when we all connected,' she added. Sue Docken was also sold for $500 in 1951 from on office building in Butte. The transaction was expected to last just a few minutes, so her adoptive's mother's husband was told to leave the car running as he waited outside. She went back to the empty office building about a month ago to see where the exchange unfolded. Mable Deane, 65, who runs the Gertie's Babies website, was given up in 1949, and is yet to learn much about her past. Pitkanen was never held accountable for the black market scheme which tore families apart. She was born in 1878 and trained as a nurse and chiropractor before moving with her husband Gustave Pitkanen to Butte. She died in 1960, but escaped criminal prosecution. It's not known how much money she made from the scheme or how many of the adoptions she organised over at least three decades. According to The New York Times she worked with the political and business elite and had a 'black book' with intelligence she could use as blackmail. She was charged with botched abortions on multiple occasions, but each time a judge threw out the case, fearing the repercussions of what she might do. Pitkanen also made her service available to prostitutes, an industry that was thriving in Butte at the time of her operation. Others who got pregnant out of wedlock or through affairs also used the service.\n\n    #Summary#: Gertrude Pitkanen started the illicit scheme in Butte, Montana in the 1920s. For around 30 years, she gave newborns to adoptive parents for cash. Children involved in the crimes have aged, and are looking for answers. Is only since the proliferation of DNA that they have found lost relatives. Group called Gertie's Babies believe there are more children out there.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Real Madrid striker sent home fans into raptures when he swept in a pass from Cristiano Ronaldo with just two minutes left to play after neat work by the Portugal international. Hernandez opted to run to the corner and celebrate on his own following his winner but Henry feels the forward, on loan from Manchester United, owes all the credit to his team-mate. Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez earns his side Champions League victory with a late, late goal. The on-loan Mexican striker wheels away in celebration as he fires Real Madrid in to the next round. Hernandez is welcomed by the ecstatic Real Madrid fans following his late goal against rivals Atletico. Henry told Sky Sports: \u2018To be fair to him he doesn\u2019t really play. He was given an opportunity tonight but we still don\u2019t know whether he will play again. \u2018He had a couple of chances in the game. One on his left foot and then another on his right foot. But I can tell you, he needs to thank (Cristiano) Ronaldo tonight. \u2018I know he went on to celebrate alone and everything but he needs to thank Ronaldo, because for me he has to. It\u2019s Ronaldo who chooses to change the course of the game. \u2018He (Ronaldo) should\u2019ve passed the ball in the first-half but he didn't, but he did in the second-half because he knew he needed to finish them (Atletico Madrid) there and then. \u2018That is for me Ronaldo\u2019s goal. There is two minutes to go, he didn\u2019t want to take that chance because he knows Hernandez is in a better position so you have to play that ball. \u2018Ronaldo gave him that ball so that goal is Ronaldo\u2019s goal. At that moment he knows he cannot shoot so he doesn\u2019t take the risk of doing something stupid or silly. The on-loan striker slides to his knees in celebrations following his late goal at the Bernabeu Stadium. Hernandez falls backwards in celebration after his late goal earned Real Madrid a Champions League victory. \u2018He saw a guy in a better position, which Hernandez was, and he gave him the ball, so that is Ronaldo\u2019s goal. \u2018What I don\u2019t like is that he celebrates like he has just won the World Cup. It\u2019s a tap in. Turn around and celebrate with Ronaldo. \u2018He knew he had to perform and he had a couple of chances to do it. Even the camera knew, the camera is on Ronaldo for a reason.\u2019 Hernandez and Ronaldo celebrate as Real Madrid beat rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Thierry Henry was quick to criticise the Mexican striker for the way in which he celebrated his winner. However, former Liverpool defender and fellow pundit Jamie Carragher was quick to highlight that Ronaldo would have done the same if it was his late winner. The 37-year-old told Sky Sports:\u00a0\u2018It was Ronaldo\u2019s goal in terms of what he did for the goal but Ronaldo is the worst in the world at things like that. 'He took a penalty in the final last year to make it 4-1, he takes his top off and becomes the picture the next day.' But former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher didn't share the same views as former Arsenal man Henry.\n\n    #Summary#: Thierry Henry criticizes Javier Hernandez for overly celebrating his Champions League winning goal. Hernandez, on loan from Manchester United, owes his success to Ronaldo who gave him the perfect assist. Ronaldo's goal was the real game changer as he made the move that led to Hernandez's tap in. Despite Henry's criticism, Jamie Carragher believes Ronaldo would celebrate the same way if it were his goal.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",
        "source": "halu_summ",
        "res": " Based on the information provided, I believe that the summary contains some non-factual information and hallucinations.\n\nFirstly, the summary suggests that Thierry Henry criticized Javier Hernandez for overly celebrating his Champions League winning goal, implying that Henry thinks Hernandez did not deserve to celebrate as much since he only had a simple tap-in. However, the original article does not mention anything about Henry criticizing Hernandez's celebration.\n\nSecondly, the summary implies that Ronaldo's goal was the real game changer, suggesting that without Ronaldo's assist, Hernandez would not have scored. While it is true that Ronaldo played a crucial role in creating the scoring opportunity, the final goal was still scored by Hernandez, and it is unfair to diminish his achievement.\n\nFinally, the summary quotes Jamie Carragher as saying that Ronaldo would have celebrated the same way if it were his goal. However, the original article does not include any quote from Carragher, and it is unclear where this statement comes from.\n\nTherefore, my judgment is that the summary contains non-factual information and hallucinations, and it is not entirely accurate in representing the contents of the original article."

In an interview with Town & Country Magazine, the 68-year-old revealed that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning, adding that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality which once helped to propel him to victory. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' he said. Scroll down for video. Back seat? President Clinton plans to stay out of the limelight if and when Hillary Clinton launches her expected run for president, he tells Town and Country Magazine in a new interview. Doting grandparents: The Clintons had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - a dream which came true last year when their daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte (pictured) Undecided role: 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad,' he said. 'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' The interview provides a rare inside look at the couple's mindset ahead of a widely expected impending presidential announcement. According to reports, Mrs Clinton is currently in the process of preparing to launch her bid within the next two weeks, and she's rumored to have already signed a lease for her campaign office in Brooklyn. However, she has to officially declare as a candidate within the next two weeks if she is going to run. If Mrs Clinton is elected, the former President added that his wife 'would have to assess what she wants me to do'. In addition to his new, calmer outlook on life, former President Clinton may have other reasons for wanting to avoid playing an active part in his wife's campaign. Ready for more? Mrs Clinton is widely expected to launch a bid within the next two weeks. Looking back: The former President's role in Hillary's 2008 campaign was reportedly a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. According to reports at the time, his role in his wife's 2008 campaign was a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. Many of his political advisers joined her campaign, and some of them didn't get on with Mrs Clinton's staff. And this time around, Mrs Clinton is thought to be off on a good foot, holding a substantial lead over her fellow Democrats, as well as a top spot in general election polling. Mr Clinton added that the couple has not discussed what her campaign \u2013 or her potential election \u2013 would mean for their philanthropic foundation. 'We might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should,' he said. 'You can't. It's hard for any party to hang onto the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen.' Whatever occurs, Mr Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive whether he's running it or not. Outspoken:\u00a0The former President previously sparked controversy on his wife's campaign trail, including with remarks about President Obama's 2008 campaign being a 'fairytale' ahead of the South Carolina primary. Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The family is pictured at former President Clinton's second inauguration. The Clinton Foundation is running 3,100 projects around the world, affecting the lives of 430 million people. The former President has spoken about life as a grandfather and how watching baby Charlotte grow has been 'a hoot'. 'It's amazing,' Mr Clinton said on the Ellen Show towards the end of last year. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' Meanwhile, daughter Chelsea has said her parents are totally involved in their granddaughter's life, all the way down to changing diapers. She told Jimmy Kimmel that they are  embracing their new roles as grandma and grandpa Clinton. 'They're changing diapers, reading to her, helping her go to sleep at night,' she said. 'It's just been such a joy for me to watch them sort of rediscover that part of their lives and to watch them as grandparents.'\n\n    #Summary#: Former First Lady Hillary\u00a0Clinton has not announced whether or not she will run for President. Her husband says he will support her wishes no matter what - but will take a back-seat role if and when she begins her campaign. During her 2008 campaign, it was reported that his staffers clashed with her team.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Teacher Aaron Galloway, 23, was on a half-term city break to Prague when he left his expensive SLR camera on the seat as he landed in the Czech Republic capital. Ground crew phoned the flight attendants within minutes but cabin crew said there was no sign of the \u00a3499 Nikon. Flighty: Ryanair steward\u00a0Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu begged\u00a0Adam Galloway not to report him to police when he replied to a message warning him that he could prove that he was selling stolen goods. When Aaron got home, he went on eBay to find a replacement and was astonished to see his own camera for sale with just 35 minutes left on the auction. He messaged seller Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu, who confessed to the theft - and admitted being a Ryanair flight attendant. Aaron checked his eBay profile and found Viseu had sold 118 items in the previous few months, including Ray-Ban sunglasses and expensive Skullcandy headphones. Snapshot: Aaron realises that the camera advertised on eBay is the one he left on the flight. Rumbled: Teacher Aaron realises the seller must work for Ryanair and sends over some strong words. 35 minutes to go: The listing that Aaron Galloway found when looking for a replacement camera. The Portuguese-born thief begged Aaron not to tell police and said he would lose his job but officers raided his home near Stansted and found the D5200 Nikon. Viseu was charged with the theft of the camera as well as stealing a Kindle from an unknown owner and pleaded guilty in court. However, he's not being investigated for any other offences at this time or being pursued under the proceeds of crime act. Magistrates in Chelmsford, Essex, ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme for six months by the court on March 9 and pay \u00a3145 costs. They also imposed a community order and ordered him to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Ryanair have now sacked him. Aaron, a primary school teacher, said: 'When I saw it on Ebay I couldn't believe it. 'I was angry with Ryanair to be honest. How can they not notice someone just taking things off the seats? 'He had deleted everything from the camera - photos of Christmas, of a family member who had passed away and my graduation - all wiped. 'I'd been looking forward to taking lots of photos on my holiday and that was just ruined.' Steward Viseu posing next to a Ryanair plane, left, and Aaron Galloway, right, with his camera in Brighton. Aaron went online when he got back home to Brighton, East Sussex, after his three-night break and was astonished to see his camera. He said: 'That night I decided to check Ebay - I'm not sure what made me do it, but I thought I would just have a look. 'Right there, with just 33 minutes to go, was my camera. 'I knew it was mine because the description with the strap, the lens, the battery, the memory card - all mine. 'It was a three day auction starting the same day I lost my camera, and the item location was Stansted. 'I contact the non-emergency police number but only got through to the switchboard and I was panicking. 'So I thought I had nothing to lose so I messaged the seller, expecting them to just ignore me. 'He admitted he worked for Ryanair and had taken my camera. I was pretty surprised because actually he could have ignored me and there was nothing I could have done. 'But he said he was really sorry.' Begging: Viseu begs teacher Aaron not to report him to police and offers to return the camera. Viseu - who was listed on eBay as fstoffel2013 - sent Aaron a message saying: 'My apologies for this. I'll obviously return the camera to you. 'Please tell me when you return and I will meet you at the terminal. 'Of course my job is important to me. I'll meet you at the terminal or whatever you want to. 'I found the camera at the end of the day and I will return it to you, of course. 'Please, please don't report me.' Aaron added: 'The police initially said they wanted me to organise to go and collect it off him in person, and they would arrest him there. 'But then once I showed them the evidence they went to his home and arrested him there.' A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'We arrested a 34-year-old man from the Stansted area on Friday February 20 on suspicion of theft.'\n\n    #Summary#: A Ryanair steward has been ordered to attend drug rehabilitation after he was caught stealing a teacher's camera on a flight to Prague. The teacher, Adam Galloway, found out that his camera was for sale on eBay and messaged the seller, steward Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu, who begged him not to report him to the police.

Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.\n\n    #Summary#: A test in Kansas finds listeria in a Blue Bell ice cream cup.

But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18. It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time. Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school. His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months. But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world \u2026 and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like \"what have you got?\" and I'd say \"I think I have psychosis or depression\" and they'd just say \"OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?\" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy. 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!' As an outspoken advocate for mental health and suicide prevention who advocates loudly about the importance of seeking help, Nic aims to raise awareness about the importance of GPs - the front-line of any mental health help and diagnosis - brushing up on mental illness research and data to improve diagnoses.

'I'd also love to see people seeking help, talking about it and not being afraid, humiliated or ashamed. It's the only way to reduce stigma and make it not a big scary shameful thing. 'You're not a freak, a lot of people have these feelings and we're only doing ourselves a disservice by pretending we don't have problems, and they're actually really treatable.'

Holmes, who started the day six shots off the lead but ripped through the first half of the course to make the turn in 29, had moments before missed from 10 foot but 2008 winner Wagner could not save par to take the play-off to a third hole. Overnight leader Jordan Spieth, who hit a fine putt to par the 18th and make it a three-way play-off, had been eliminated on the first hole. J B Holmes poses with the Houston Open trophy after a thrilling climax saw him take the title. Holmes bumps fists with his caddie to celebrate winning the Houston Open after two play-off holes. Johnson Wagner watches his putt go by the hole on the second play-off, handing the title to Holmes. Spieth's one-shot overnight lead evaporated almost before he had time to warm up on the course thanks to Holmes' blistering start. Six birdies on the first seven holes saw Holmes tear into an outright lead as Spieth was easing into proceedings with his second par in as many holes. Holmes picked up a further shot on the eighth on his way to finishing the front nine on a seven-under 29 to tie the nine-hole course record with Fred Couples. The 32-year-old had a less prolific back nine, but he still picked up two further birdies, with a bogey on the 16th his only blot on a fine day's golf. He returned to the clubhouse with a two-shot lead having carded 64, but back-to-back birdies on 13 and 14 saw Spieth join Holmes on 16 under overall with four holes remaining. Holmes began the day six shots off the lead but stormed up the leaderboard with a brilliant start. Overnight leader Jordan Spieth saw his advantage go before he was on the course, but made a play-off. The 21-year-old, who could have gone second in the world rankings with victory in Houston, just missed taxing birdie shots on 16 and 17 to take it all down to his final hole. And just after his tee shot narrowly avoided the bunker, Wagner dramatically birdied the par-four 18th with a 25ft putt to card a 69 and create a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. Spieth still had the chance to win it outright but found a bunker, and he needed a fine 42ft chip and then a 12ft putt to rescue par and join the play-off. Once it began, things quickly went south for the Texan. He found the greenside bunker with his second shot, and then made a poor shot out from a difficult lie, claiming something had distracted him during his backswing. He would be eliminated with a bogey. Wagner had also run into trouble with his second shot but salvaged a par, and when Holmes missed from 10ft they headed back to the tee to try again. Spieth was the first to drop out in the play-offs, after bogeying the first hole to fall out of contention. Johnson Wagner celebrates his birdie at the eighteenth, to earn a place in the play-off, but he fell just short. Neither man had dramas on the way to the green this time but Holmes got much closer to the hole with his second approach shot, and after Wagner over-hit a long putt Holmes again had the chance to win it from 10ft. His putt drifted a couple of inches wide but Wagner's putt from four feet lipped out and Holmes could celebrate. 'I knew I had to play a really low round to have a chance, but I started out great and it worked out for me,' Holmes said on Sky Sports 4 before turning his attention to next week's Masters. 'It's great any time you get a week where you can win going into a major. I went there Monday and Tuesday and saw the course so hopefully I'm ready. I'm hitting it well, and looking forward to it.'\n\n    #Summary#: Johnson Wagner loses out to JB Holmes after second playoff hole.

The Gunners' slim hopes of overhauling Chelsea's 10-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League were all but extinguished following a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Walcott watched on from the bench again before a late substitute appearance, with the forward's last club start having been back in March. Theo Walcott believes Arsenal have been the 'best team in Europe' in the second half of the season. Arsenal had earned eight successive Premier League victories before the 0-0 draw against Chelsea. The 26-year-old - who recovered from a serious knee injury last season, but has yet to agree a new long-term deal - feels such strength in depth can only be positive for the squad, if sometimes frustrating for individuals. Fellow England internationals Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs also did not make the first XI against Chelsea. 'There is a lot of competition for places so everyone seems to lift a gear and play extremely well. It makes it a bit more difficult for people to get into the team,' Walcott said, quoted on the club's official website, www.arsenal.com. 'I think, especially this season, not many people thought we would be challenging for the Premier League. 'In this calendar year, we have been the best team in Europe. 'It is the strongest the squad has been and everyone is staying fit as well. The English midfielder (left) has struggled to maintain a first team place under Arsene Wenger this season. 'There aren't many injuries in the squad, which is important. If we had an injury-free season, I think we could lift the title.' Arsenal head to Hull on Bank Holiday Monday looking to keep pressure on Manchester City in the race for second place, and with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League. Captain Mikel Arteta is set to step up his training this week after an ankle problem hampered recovery from a calf injury, while midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another continuing rehabilitation from an inflamed groin which has seen him out since the FA Cup win at Manchester United last month.\n\n    #Summary#: Theo Walcott is confident that Arsenal will win the Premier League title next season if they continue their good form. Arsenal has been the top-performing team in Europe and Walcott says that the competition between players is good for the squad. With players staying fit this season, Walcott believes that Arsenal could lift the title if they have an injury-free run.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

After being checked face-first into the glass by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook, Reaves went to the bench and pulled out his own tooth. Reaves calmly digs around his mouth until he grabs the loose tooth, pulls it out of his mouth and hands it to his trainer. St. Louis forward Ryan Reaves (pictured) pulled out his own tooth after being checked into the glass by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook. Reaves sat on the bench as he calmly pulled out the tooth. It eventually fell into his hand (pictured above) and he gave it to a team trainer. It is unknown as to what period the check occurred in or if Reaves returned to the ice, one tooth lighter. The St. Louis 2-1 win moved the team a point ahead of Nashville for the Central Division lead with just three games left in the season. Reaves isn't the only hockey player to make headlines for being tough in the last week, however. Prior to losing his tooth on Sunday, Reaves, pictured here April 3, appeared to have a full mouth of perfectly straight pearly whites, something that's a bit unusual in the hockey world. Reaves and the rest of the Blues beat the Blackhawks 2-1 on Sunday, moving the team a point ahead of Nashville to the top of the Central Division standings. Red Wings left wing Drew Miller was hit in the face by Ottawa Senators forward Mark Stone's ice skate after a face off on March 31. the skate him him across his right cheekbone and he quickly skated off the ice to the on-scene doctor in fear that he might have lost his eye. He received between 50 and 60 stitches after the incident but the skate luckily missed his eye, according to MLive. Miller, who has the longest-running game attendance on the Red Wings team, returned to the ice for his 159th consecutive game with the team two days later on April 2 against the Boston Bruins.\n\n    #Summary#: St. Louis Blues forward Ryan Reaves was checked into the glass on Sunday by\u00a0Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook.

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.\n\n    #Summary#: The raging wildfires in Siberia caused a massive heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, resulting in a fiery sunset that awed Seattle natives. The amber-colored haze originated from the fire's smoke, which also destroyed dozens of villages in Siberia.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Steven Allison, 37, formerly of Idle near Bradford, West Yorkshire, had been uploading pictures of himself looking tanned and happy as he enjoyed his freedom in his new life Down Under. But he was unaware the net was closing in as British police teamed up with colleagues in Australia and Interpol to locate Allison, who was living in the country's capital, Canberra. Steven Allison (left) was uploading pictures of himself in Australia to Facebook and writing posts about his former life in Yorkshire (right) despite being on the running from the law. Allison had already been on the run for a year when he was given a 30 month jail sentence for sexually assaulting two women after failing to turn up at Bradford Crown Court in February last year. He was supposed to be lying low in Sydney, where he found work as a labourer and handyman, but couldn't resist showing off his new life to his 739 Facebook friends. The sex attacker, who goes by 'Stig' on Facebook, posted pictures of his former life in Yorkshire and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle, saying he wanted to meet women. Allison even joked about days being drunk in his hometown, including posts such as 'fooocking leathered that day,, for a change haha [sic]'. He also posted pictures of himself in his t-shirt on a building site with his arms raised in a mocking salute to Facebook friends, many of whom had no idea about his criminal past. The assaults happened in June 2013 when Allison had been out drinking with a friend in Yeadon, Leeds, where he approached two women who rejected his advances. Allison would not take no for an answer and indecently assaulted one of his victims as she left the pub in disgust. He had been laying low in Sydney (pictured) before moving to Canberra, where authorities closed in on him. When her friend threw a drink over him the rugby fan snapped and punched both girls to the ground. A West Yorkshire force spokesman said Allison had been charged with two sexual assaults but failed to appear in court. He added: 'Enquiries made by Bradford District's Public Protection Unit and Interpol traced him to Australia, where he had been working on construction sites. 'He was located in January this year and subsequently held in a detention centre, while arrangements were made for him to be returned to the UK.' While being held, Allison made one last bid for freedom by feigning an arm injury so he could attempt to escape while being taken for medical treatment. But his plan failed and he was brought back to the UK yesterday in handcuffs and flanked by three security guards from Australia. Det Insp Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia. 'He fled to the other side of the world to escape justice. However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world.' He\u00a0is expected to appear in court before being transferred to prison.\n\n    #Summary#: Steven Allison, 37, uploaded pictures of himself looking happy and tanned. He fled to Australia after going on run from the law more than a year ago. Police were closing in on him with help of Interpol and Australian officers. Allison was given 30 month jail sentence for sexual assault of two women. He was supposed to be lying low but couldn't help post clues on Facebook.

On Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault and mistreatment of a prisoner against William Melendez. He's the 49-year-old former Inkster, Michigan, police officer who is seen in police car dashcam video grabbing the unarmed motorist, Floyd Dent, around the neck while he lay on the ground and punching him several times in the head. \"The alleged police brutality in this case cannot and will not be tolerated,\" Worthy said. On Wednesday, drug charges against Dent, 57, were formally dropped in Michigan Circuit Court, clearing the motorist of all wrongdoing. \"He busted out crying and was very emotional,\" said Angela Martin, the assistant to Dent's attorney. In the wake of the reversal of fates, Police Chief Vicki Yost announced Wednesday her resignation, according to Inkster City Manager Richard Marsh. Marsh would not cite a specific reason for Yost's investigation, though she had been the face of the Police Department during the investigation into her former officer. In a statement, Dent and his attorney Greg Rohl told CNN: \"We are all ecstatic, especially Mr. Dent. This is another step in the right direction. The system is still working, and we are very hopeful the prosecutor's net will catch even more fish in the near future.\" Yost did not respond to a request for comment. Dent, a veteran Ford automotive worker, was arrested after the January traffic stop on charges of drug possession, assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. With the court decision Wednesday, all charges from the arrest have been dropped. Melendez pleaded not guilty to the new charges brought against him in an arraignment Tuesday at Inkster District Court, according to his lawyer, David Lee. \"We intend to vigorously contest the charges,\" Lee said. \"I can understand how people might be disturbed by looking at [the video]; however; I hope everyone will withhold judgment until all the facts come out where they should in a court of law.\" Worthy's announcement came after the conclusion of two investigations into the incident by Michigan State Police and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. In the police report written after the January arrest, Melendez wrote that he hit Dent only after Dent had threatened him and bit him in the arm. Melendez wrote that as he approached the car, Dent kept his hands from view, looked at him \"with a blank stare as if on a form of narcotic,\" and said, \"I'll kill you.\" Dent told CNN at the time that he had never threatened nor bit the police officer. \"I didn't bite anyone. I didn't have time to bite anyone. He was too busy pounding me in my head,\" Dent said.

The summary states that Melendez tearfully pleaded not guilty to the charges, but the document does not mention any tears or emotional display from Melendez.\n3. The summary implies that the motorist, Floyd Dent, was cleared of all wrongdoing, but the document only mentions that the drug charges against him were dropped, without clarifying whether he was innocent or not.\n4.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has made the headlines throughout his trophy-laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32-year-old striker. Search engine zlaaatan.com has immortalised the Paris Saint-Germain forward with the site totally devoted to the French giants' No 10. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had a search engine website created in his honour called\u00a0zlaaatan.com. The website has an identical  style to Google with users given the option\u00a0to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan' In a house style that is identical to Google, and operates just like the search engine, users have the option to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan.' The click of the former button takes users to articles about Ibrahimovic on Google, while the latter directs them to his Wikipedia page. In addition any results from the search bar will automatically add 'Zlatan' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news. It must be said though that website is neither affiliated with Ibrahimovic nor Google. The website though has no affliation with the Paris Saint-Germain No 10 (left) nor Google. Creative director of  SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, Andreas Killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the Sweden international. 'We didn't ask his permission, but we hope he sees it as an amusing experience,' he said. 'Our search engine is linked to Google but all the searches are Zlatanified. All the results have some link to Zlatan... if you type in Ferrari, you'll get stuff about Zlatan's Ferrari; if you want a recipe, you'll get the Zlatan Burger. 'Zlatan is an idol. He's known the world over. That's why we chose him.' SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, hope that Ibrahimovic (left) will find it amusing. As memorable as he can be with his feet, Zlatan Ibrahimovic can also do likewise with his tongue. Sportsmail reminds you of 10 of the Sweden international's best quotes. 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d'Or award, but it clearly didn't affect the striker's confidence in his own ability. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself. 'I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was like \"No way, Zlatan doesn\u2019t do auditions\".' Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club. 'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.' As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan. 'Well, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask your wife about that.' As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn't, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face. 'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.' Ibrahimovic didn't take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew. 'Come to my house and you'll see if I'm gay, and bring your sister.' During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter. 'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.' Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club's Serie A title success. 'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.' After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic's at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks. 'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.' Ibrahimovic's short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team.\n\n    #Summary#: Zlatan Ibrahimovic has launched his own search engine website, called zlaaatan.com, which is similar to Google. The site is dedicated to providing users with results that are entirely about the Paris Saint-Germain striker. Search options include 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan.' Every search on the site is automatically 'Zlatanified,' even if users type in a topic such as 'recipe,' the results will always relate to Ibrahimovic. The creative director of the agency which created the site hopes it will make the Swedish striker proud, even though it has no affiliation with Google.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

And now, Rita Ora - who is only 24 and has already made the transition from a Kosovan-born fledgling singer to one of the globe's most successful stars - has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range. For her latest collaboration with adidas Originals, Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Scroll down for video. Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future. Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I\u2019ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body-mind-soul connection, about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, couldn't be happier with the final result. She said: 'I love being able to go into design meetings with all these crazy ideas and then be able to create a product that hasn\u2019t existed before. From the initial stages to seeing my fans wearing the clothes and shoes - it\u2019s been an amazing experience.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, shows off her toned abs in the new campaign shoot. Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there\u2019s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I\u2019m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I\u2019m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I\u2019ve always loved that London street style, but I\u2019ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I\u2019ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I\u2019ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I\u2019m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'. Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita, pictured judging on The Voice, explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. As well as conquering the fashion world, the humble star has been busy making music, starring in Fifty Shades Of Grey and spending time with her beau, Ricky Hilfiger. So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it\u2019s probably fortunate that I don\u2019t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world. \u00a0'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It\u2019s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I\u2019m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I\u2019d love to continue down that path. But music has always and will always be my main love and passion. 'In five years' time, hopefully I will still be creating music and being able to live my dreams surrounded with the people I love. I\u2019m so grateful for the opportunities I\u2019ve had so far, I\u2019m excited to see what the future will hold.'

Their only exposure tends to be upsetting scenes on their television screens or negative stories in the newspaper, but its people are using the power of social media to show their homeland in a positive light. One of the brightest stars, Ugaaso Abukar Boocow, has become a celebrity on Instagram, where she is trying to change people\u2019s perceptions with photos and videos that reveal a side of Somalia that most people have never seen.

        "res": " Based on the provided document and summary, my judgment is that the summary contains non-factual and hallucinated information. Here are my reasons why:\n\n* The summary claims that Ugaaso Abukar Boocow is set to transform the global narrative on Somalia, showcasing its beautiful beaches, happy locals, and stunning scenery in her regular posts on Instagram. However, the document does not support this claim. While it mentions that Ugaaso has gained popularity on Instagram and is trying to change people's perceptions of Somalia, it does not suggest that she is single-handedly transforming the global narrative on the country.\n* The summary states that Abukar Boocow has nearly 100,000 followers on Instagram, while the document reports that she has around 68,000 followers. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may contain inaccurate information.\n* The summary describes Ugaaso Abukar Boocow as a \"vital voice\" for the East African nation, implying that she holds significant influence over how Somalia is perceived globally. However, the document only portrays her as a young woman sharing her experiences and observations about Somalia through Instagram, without indicating that she has achieved any sort of widespread recognition or authority.\n\nTherefore, based on these inconsistencies and exaggerations, I conclude that the summary contains non-factual and hallucinated information."

Filmed at the Orana Wildlife Park \u2013 the country\u2019s only open-range zoo \u2013 the video shows the lions interacting with the visitors who stand inside a metal cage attached to a car. The video, which was captured by Ekant Veer, 35, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury, also shows the lions scaling the cage and eating meat through its bars. The lions at Orana Wildlife Park approach the metal cage and begin interacting with the people inside. Standing with its paws against the cage, a lion is introduced as Sakura who is around 11-years-old and weighs about 265kg. As the keeper speaks, the lion licks at a piece of meat that is held up against the bars as another lion walks across the roof of the cage. Looking down at the people below, the lion wanders around as if deciding who it would like to make its prey before staring down the lens of the camera. Set tongues wagging! One of the lions notices meat and begins sticking out its tongue in the hope of being fed. A lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady's head. The people inside can be seen recording the many lions from their phones, while another \u2013 with paws the same size as the keeper\u2019s head \u2013 holds itself up against the cage and chews on some meat. Later in the video people can be seen pointing out the various felines as a keeper moves her hand along the cage, instigating the lion to follow. Still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper \u2013 its power and size is plain to see. A keeper holds a piece of meat up to the bars of the cage and a lion follows her hand in the hope of receiving it. A number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars, while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage. The car then begins driving away and the lions can be seen chasing after the people in the hope of receiving more food. A keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food. The video concludes with one lion picking up a final lump of meat from the floor and being chased by another, angry feline. A lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat. The people inside can be seen pointing and filming the lion who wanders along the top of the cage above them. Orana Wildlife Park was opened in 1976 and is owned and operated by registered charity, Orana Wildlife Trust. Located on the outskirts of Christchurch, the wildlife park is unique in that the people are caged in order to view the animals, not the other way around.\n\n    #Summary#: Video shows the lions scaling the cage to look at the people inside.

The compartment was extremely crowded. As we prepared to disembark, I felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts. It was terrible. I wanted to scream, but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd. I wanted to push the hands away, but my arms were pinned to my body. I wanted to cry but could only think to myself, \"Stop it! Please stop touching me.\" I was 13 years old. I never told anyone about that day until recently. Twenty-five years later, I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces. The stories can be stomach churning: men masturbating on buses and at bus stops, boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online, men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the Internet. Then there are just the everyday, uncomfortable stares, frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations. This isn't all simply anecdotal. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai had been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms. Most people, including women, only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching, groping and stalking, not to mention the \"milder\" forms of ogling, leering, catcalling and whistling, even though all of this can be intimidating. Indeed, many women choose to limit their hours outside, select more conservative clothes, or opt for a longer but safer route home. It was only recently that I realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience I had as a child. I still avoid trains when I can. Most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women. It was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop I led that \"staring and commenting by men is normal and I've learned to ignore it.\" The reality is that sexual harassment in India is pervasive in all aspects of life. It hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street, take local transport, go about your daily routine or at the workplace. According to U.N. Women's report, 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This statistic is likely even higher in India. Out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops I've conducted, only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives. Shockingly, less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel. Why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment? Over the past two years, I have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in India. It is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment. I know firsthand. But acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step. India has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace, and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser. But is it enough? Women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling \"ashamed\" and bringing \"disrepute\" to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police, who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged. However, despite the barriers, two recent cases in India provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power, coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference. There is, for example, the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages. Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked. His counsel stated in court that Pachauri's inbox was not hacked, but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name. Similarly, last year, Tarun Tejpal, founder of one of India's leading media companies, was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator. She first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously.  She then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police. Tarun Tejpal, who explained the incident as a \"bad lapse of judgment,\" was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing. Women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers. Women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up. The alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives, restricted and disempowered. We cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine. We cannot ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women.\n\n    #Summary#: The sexual harassment of women in India is on the decline due to the increasing awareness among people.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday. Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker. MICHAEL BROWN. Burnley CC team-mate, now club chairman. We used to call Jimmy the \u2018Pro Killer\u2019. Playing in the Lancashire League, he\u2019d regularly get the opposition professional out. He was quite a slight kid. It was probably when he was 17 that we thought, wow, he\u2019s got some pace. And he had this ability to bowl jaffas. When he bowled so brilliantly against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup everyone at Burnley was saying: \u2018We\u2019ve seen these magic balls before.\u2019 Anderson was known as Pro Killer during his days with Burnley, reveals former team-mate and now club chairman Michael Brown. My mum can take some of the credit for Jimmy being signed by Lancashire. He was bowling really well for Burnley, and she rang up John Stanworth, who was at the club at the time. Jimmy was invited for trials by Lancashire and that was that. He was always a shy lad. But he cares very much. JOHN STANWORTH. Former Lancashire player development manager. His potential was brought to my attention by Val Brown so I\u2019m not going to take credit for unearthing Jimmy. I didn\u2019t necessarily think he\u2019d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him. When he arrived for Under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace. But it was the late swing that stood out. Even established batsmen struggled to line him up. They were playing and missing all the time. He made them look ordinary. In the early days I just left him alone. He had these unusual mannerisms, like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery, and a strange rotation of the shoulders. But I ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out. I just said: \u2018We\u2019ve got a 17-year-old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out!\u2019 WARREN HEGG. Anderson\u2019s first captain at Lancashire and wicketkeeper. He burst on to the scene in my first year as captain. There was talk of this kid from the valleys in Lancashire. He wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action. He bowled to me in a centre net practice at Old Trafford and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin. I thought: \u2018Either I\u2019m losing it or this kid\u2019s special\u2019. And he really was. We sat down with coach Mike Watkinson and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball. So we\u2019d have three slips, a gully and a deep point. It gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler. He went from strength to strength. Anderson (back row second from left) 'wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light,' says his 2002 Lancashire captain Warren Hegg (front row fifth from left) He was a keeper\u2019s dream. He was in the high-80s and took the ball away so I always thought I was going to get a nick. That said, he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early. He bowled James Middlebrook down at Chelmsford and I dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails. But I could console myself with the thought that I\u2019d kept to England\u2019s best. MIKE WATKINSON. Anderson\u2019s first coach at Lancashire. I was coaching the Lancashire second team when Jimmy arrived. He had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent. Some would swing, others wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and I did some work with him before one game at Middleton. I tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips. He related to it straight away. Since then, he\u2019s worked things out for himself. Jimmy\u2019s been his own best coach. IAN WARD. Anderson\u2019s first first-class victim: Lancashire v Surrey, Old Trafford, May 31, 2002. He was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet. His run-up was the same. I just remember him being quality. He had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first. To me, a left-hander, it was an awayswinger. I remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to Warren Hegg. Sky Sports commentator Ian Ward (left with Shane Warne) was Jimmy's first first-class victim. I thought \u2018Christ, this guy can bowl!\u2019 In those days Lancashire had Peter Martin and Glen Chapple and we weren\u2019t expecting them to go on forever. We thought, they\u2019ve found another one already. That was the talk in the Surrey dressing-room. And when he got Ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different. MARK RAMPRAKASH. Dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match. I faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump. But they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper\u2019s gloves quite hard. He was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick. Mark Ramprakash, now England batting coach, was dismissed LBW with the first ball of the second innings. In the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball. It was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front. I was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing, or maybe reverse. It was a terrific delivery. You tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away. It raised a few eyebrows. At the Old Trafford Test against India last summer I was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and I couldn\u2019t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling. To witness that live was amazing. NASSER HUSSAIN. Anderson\u2019s first England captain, in 2002-03. He came into the team after yet another Ashes disaster. He was a breath of fresh air, a natural talent - very un-English! He wasn\u2019t over-coached or too technical. He just ran in and bowled swing. He was the kind of player you might get from Pakistan. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup. For such a young lad, he wasn\u2019t someone you needed to over-manage or look after. He was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. If anything I probably had such a good impression of him that I gave him more responsibility than I should have done - like bowling him instead of Andrew Caddick at the end of our World Cup game against Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003. He got hit for six and I apologised to him later. He was playing pool, shrugged his shoulders, and got on with his game. But I knew he was going to be one of our greats. It\u2019s one thing being a swing bowler but it\u2019s the way he could get it to go so late. I faced him just once and he got me first ball at Old Trafford as part of a hat-trick. He\u2019s a very clever cricketer. MARK BUTCHER. Man of the match on Anderson\u2019s Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord\u2019s in 2003. Anderson celebrates the wicket of Zimbabwe's Travis Friend with Michael Vaughan (right) and Robert Key (left) during his debut Test at Lord's in May 2003, in which Mark Butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match. Like Jimmy, I took five wickets in that game. I like to think I taught him everything he knows about swing bowling. This was the first time I\u2019d seen him close up. He swung it both ways and at serious pace. I thought, we\u2019ve found one here. I took a catch off him. Andy Bignaut was trying to work one through square-leg but he nicked it to slip. It was a cracking delivery. It\u2019s an easy thing to do when you\u2019re new to get your bouncer through quickly, then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length. But his full balls were coming out at a good pace too. He was brilliant.\n\n    #Summary#: James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua starting Monday.

In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years \u2018trying to lift people up\u2019 by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. \u2018Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,\u2019 he insisted. Scroll down for video. Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday. Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country\u2019s 30million Christians should \u2018approach the General Election\u2019. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a \u2018fresh moral vision\u2019. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition\u2019s welfare policies, which include a \u00a326,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were \u2018described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient\u2019. They insisted it was \u2018game-playing \u2026 to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is\u2026 careless about the extent of national indebtedness\u2019. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM. Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that \u2018the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders\u2019. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality. Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the \u2018values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built\u2019. \u2018I\u2019m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion \u2013 compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility \u2013 are values that we can all celebrate and share,\u2019 he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was \u2018a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith\u2019. \u2018But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,\u2019 he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to \u2018banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world\u2019s problems\u2019, and instead it was about \u2018the right judgement\u2026 based on clear values and beliefs\u2019. He said the Government had inherited \u2018exceptional pressure on the national finances\u2019 from Labour, adding: \u2018I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. \u2018We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. \u2018More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme \u2013 dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy \u2013 is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.\u2019 Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered \u2018thousands of quiet kindnesses\u2019 to those most in need. \u2018To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.\u2019 Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday. A survey of voters in the Lib Dem leader\u2019s Sheffield Hallam constituency put Labour on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister's wife: Samantha Cameron arrives for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Samantha Cameron yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of Rochester and Strood, held by former Tory Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip and won a by-election last year. Despite his victory, the Conservatives are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the General Election. Reckless\u2019s party Ukip, meanwhile, has said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the European Union. Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to \u2018propaganda\u2019 from Brussels in a bid to \u2018catch them young\u2019. Suzanne Evans said: \u2018It\u2019s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. \u2018The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.\u2019 It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal.\n\n    #Summary#: Prime Minister said Coalition had spent 5 years 'trying to lift people up' In an Easter message to Christians he defended 'moral content' of cuts.

And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras \u00a0\u2013 and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere. The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos. The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts. Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet\u2019s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km). It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California. \u2018The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,\u2019 wrote Mr Zastrow. \u2018The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms. \u2018As they descend into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.\u2019 He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the\u00a0Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. It would not be the first experiment with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, though. In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp). Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. In Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology. The station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims.\n\n    #Summary#: Researchers in California have discovered how to control the weather by creating auroras using high-energy particles fired from a particle accelerator in space. These artificial auroras could also lead to the creation of lightning in the atmosphere. The experiment would involve firing beams at the Earth's atmosphere, with the accelerator being located 300km above the ground. The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, offers numerous scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere. It may even be possible to control different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. The idea, while still being a concept, could change the course of global climate.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Leeds-born wicketkeeper entered the record books in 2011 when he lined up against Durham University just 27 days after his 15th birthday. But that match proved to be his only appearance at senior level and he never again progressed from the second XI. Ben Gibson, pictured at the age of 15, has decided to retire from cricket just four years after his debut. The 19-year-old said it was a 'difficult decision' to retire from cricket at such a young age. In his last game for the second string he did not bat or keep wicket, instead sending down 3.3 overs for 29 runs. 'This was a difficult decision to make,' the 19-year-old said. 'I would like to thank the players and staff at Yorkshire for their support. I have been involved with the club since I was 11 and I feel that now is the right time for me to look at a career change. 'The support from my parents has been tremendous and I would like to thank Ralph Middlebrook at Pudsey Congs Cricket Club and England coach Paul Farbrace, who I had close working relationships with.' Yorkshire's director of cricket development Ian Dews, said: 'Everyone at the club wishes Barney well. 'It is very much his decision.

Police revealed it was not the first time the gunman, who has not been identified, had sparked security concerns at the park, where the mother of his child works in a restaurant. Last week he was escorted off the premises - just days after he vandalized his ex-girlfriend's car. But despite court orders banning him from the park in Hollywood, California, he was spotted  at 2.15pm near the water slides, where he shot himself dead in front of children and families. Chaos: Crowds were seen running around Universal Studios in Hollywood, California, not long after the shooting. Smoking area: The man was said to have shot himself in a secluded part of the theme park, near a Depiscable Me-themed ride. He was standing in a smoking area behind the Despicable Me Minion Mayhem ride at the time. Sheriff's deputies who rushed to the scene engaged the man in conversation but were unable to restrain him. 'The deputy tried to talk him out of it, but after going back and forth for 30 seconds or so, he shot himself, ' Lt. Eddie Hernandez told\u00a0NBC. Four visitors witnessed the suicide, he said. Inside: This video from social media shows guests being herded inside the Despicable Me ride in the aftermath of the shooting. 'Suicide': According to reports, the man turned a gun on himself around the Despicable Me Minion Mayhem ride, shown above. The ride was closed temporarily and guests were filmed being herded inside the ride by staff in the wake of the killing. Universal Studios has an official policy\u00a0banning all weapons from its grounds, and searches guests before they enter. It is not clear how the man got past the checks. A parks spokesman told NBC Southern California: 'The safety and security of our guests is always of utmost importance. Business remains open.'\n\n    #Summary#: A male suspect opened fire and killed himself in front of a large crowd at the Universal Studios in Hollywood, California, despite the place having banned weapons on their premises.

Arsene Wenger had been talking about how it was easier to set up a team designed primarily to defend, just as Brendan Rodgers had ventured after Chelsea\u2019s victory at Liverpool, last year. \u2018It\u2019s not easy, not easy,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018If it was easy, you wouldn\u2019t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It\u2019s not easy to defend.\u2019 Jose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on Friday. Arsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League. Arsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes. Monaco, ouch. Mourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco. They conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on. When Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision. \u2018Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,\u2019 said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday. \u2018Our job is to win football games and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in recent games. What\u2019s important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It\u2019s easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.\u2019 It is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title. Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the media. Prince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the Emirates. Wenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeat. The challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again? \u2018We have played amazingly well for most of the season,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team. \u2018But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.\u2019 Diego Costa\u2019s injuries and suspensions were Chelsea\u2019s shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal. Still they win, taking six points from their last two games \u2014 against QPR and Manchester United \u2014 while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. \u2018We are top since day one,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time out. Hazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league title. A TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge. \u2018We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam\u2019s from midfield, but spectacular team goals. \u2018So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.\u2019 It will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger\u2019s Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One. Since then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade \u2014 even during his six-year absence. Mourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers. The pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital. Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup final. They rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital. For many years, Wenger pursued Chelsea for \u2018financial doping\u2019 and, more recently, their tactical style, while Mourinho gorged on Arsenal\u2019s nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change. Mourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest. There has been no apology. \u2018No, but I don\u2019t need that,\u2019 shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? \u2018I don\u2019t feel, I know,\u2019 he said.\n\n    #Summary#: Chelsea can secure the league title if they beat Arsenal and Leicester.

Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers. He called the texts 'despicable' and says those who sent them 'clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer.' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr (pictured) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired. Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist, sexist and homophobic messages. Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that don't have contact with the public. The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger, who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison. 'All n*****s must f*****g hang' and 'N*****s must be spayed' were among the texts uncovered. 'It's not against the law to put an animal down,' an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger's house. Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f**. The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox, 42, a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin, a 12-year veteran, according to the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle's sources. Officers identified as Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year-veteran, Noel Schwab, 49, a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis, who has been on the force for 16 years, have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign. Sean Doherty, an 11-year veteran and\u00a0Rain Daugherty, a 15-year-officer, are also facing termination. Robison, Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned. Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year veteran of the force, has resigned. He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 (pictured) about being a gay officer. He said 'the \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month. The eighth officer has not yet been identified, and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday. Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998: 'The \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out, and the newer generation that's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed. In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was\u00a0accused\u00a0of hitting a gay man's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club. 'Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets?\u2019 Fox allegedly said. He  did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed. Police commissioners at the time reached a $83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man. The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed. Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013. Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife's hotel room. Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed. He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco's police as it did with officers in Ferguson, Missouri, according to KQED.\n\n    #Summary#: Several San Francisco police officers have been suspended and recommended for firing for sending racist and homophobic texts.

Driver Mei Ru, 50, and her husband Song Ming, 53, were going shopping when she parked the car outside the local supermarket in the city of Fuzhou, in Fujian province, south east China. CCTV from the scene shows Mr Ming climbing out of the passenger door and going to stand behind the car when his wife suddenly reverses, knocking him down before backing up over his body. Mei Ru, 50, was going shopping in the Chinese city of\u00a0Fuzhou, in the south eastern province of\u00a0Fujian, when she parked her car and her husband climbed out the passenger side. Thinking his wife had stopped, Mr Song walked around and stood behind the vehicle just as she reversed, knocking him to the ground. Passer-by Kuan Tseng, 32, said: 'It seemed that she had already parked the car so when he stood behind it there didn't seem to be any danger. 'But then the car reversed and he screamed out as it knocked him to the ground. I ran over to see if he was okay but he was unconscious. 'The woman was hysterical and begging him to wake up, but I think he was already dead.' Song was rushed to hospital where surgeons battled to save his life, but he died from massive internal bleeding and broken ribs. Tragic: CCTV footage taken at the scene then shows Mrs Ru backing up over his body as concerned passers-by rush over to held the couple. Deadly: Mr Song was rushed to hospital where surgeons battled to save him, but he later died from broken ribs and massive internal bleeding, doctors said. A hospital spokesman said: 'The force of his head hitting the ground and then the car running over his body was too much. 'Sadly he died from massive internal bleeding and crushed ribs. His wife is grief-stricken and is being treated by doctors here for shock.'

A convicted burglar and white supremacist has pleaded not guilty to killing one person and wounding five others in a rampage in Arizona, USA. Ryan Giroux is accused of shooting three people in a Phoenix motel, killing a man and injuring two women during the incident in March 18 in the suburb of Mesa, and will now stand trial. Another man was shot while working at a nearby restaurant, and then two more at separate apartment complexes, about two miles away. Police swarmed the city in a massive response, with Mesa police using sniffer dogs and searching cars to find the gunman, placing several buildings, a school and college in \u2018lockdown\u2019. The search ended with Giroux\u2019s arrest in an empty apartment. The 41-year-old has now pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder and 22 other charges at a hearing at the Maricopa County Superior Court on Monday. He has convictions in three states totally more than eight years for burglary, theft, armed aggravated assault and a marijuana violation, according to a previous statement from the Arizona Department of Corrections. Scroll down for video. Giroux is pictured in an earlier mugshot with tattoos of the words 'SKIN' and 'HEAD' over his shaven eyebrows. He has been accused of shooting dead one man and injuring five others during a rampage in Phoenix, Arizona. Police launched a massive manhunt to find the culprit behind the shootings, locking down a school and college. Giroux is reported to be a member of the Hammerskin Nation, a notoriously violent racist skinhead group connected with the Aryan Brotherhood. He previously had the words \u2018SKIN\u2019 and \u2018HEAD\u2019 tattooed over his eyebrows, but recent photos suggest these have been removed.

The comedian was outraged when he came across the picture of American grandmother-of-nine Rebecca Francis, who won the reality TV show Extreme Huntress in 2010. 'What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?' a furious Gervais tweeted. Trophy: Ricky Gervais posted this picture of Extreme Huntress winner Rebecca Francis on his Twitter feed. Disgust: The animal-lover sent it out with this message - which got retweeted thousands of times. Proud: Francis, a grandmother-of-nine, is passionate about hunting - and regularly posts pictures of her kills. Francis then found herself at the centre of a social media storm, as 14,543 people retweeted it - with some even tweeting they hoped she dies 'a lonely, painful death'. Jason Arnopp (\u200f@JasonArnopp) tweeted: 'It's a special kind of psychopathy, it really is.' The Doom \u200f(@JamesVonDoom) added: 'Why the **** are they shooting Giraffes? A standing giraffe is probably easier to hit than a \"sitting duck\".' Despite the outcry, Francis, a mother of eight in her mid-40s, is far from alone in her passion for hunting down animals for sport. Tens of thousands of tourists travel to Africa every year to collect 'trophies', from warthogs to elephants. Those wanting to hunt down giraffes to add to their collections can do so quite easily, with entire tour companies dedicated to the 'sport'. Killing a giraffe will cost somewhere in the region of $3,000, or \u00a32,037, with the cost of the day's hunting on top - about $440 (\u00a3298). Extreme: Francis' biography reveals she hopes to inspire more women to get involved with hunting. Global: She has travelled all over the world to hunt - shooting dead zebra, lion and giraffes. Record: Francis has recently achieved the 'Grand Slam of North America' - hunting down all the species of sheep native to the continent with her bow. She is only the second woman to achieve the feat. But while those like Gervais are horrified by the idea, Francis is a proud advocate for the sport - which has seen her travel the world in search of the latest 'trophy'. Indeed, a biography for Francis on Sheepshape - a 'documentary/reality' programme which follows four hunters trying to overcome a set of personal problems by hunting North American sheep - says: 'Rebecca loves to share her passion for hunting with her kids and other women. 'She hopes to help more women get out there and pursue their interest.' Her own website boasts of becoming the second American woman to get the 'Grand Slam of North America' with her bow - which means she has killed all four species native to North America. 'Achieving the full curl with a bow is like reaching the top of that mountain and crossing that finish line, which was my dream that began 18 years ago when I came home from my first rifle sheep hunt,' she told the Unita County Herald. The MailOnline has contacted Francis for a comment.\n\n    #Summary#: Comedian Ricky Gervais led an online charge against Rebecca Francis. The Brit shared a picture of the grandmother lying next to her 'trophy' Caused to an online backlash against Francis - with 14,543 retweeting post. Francis is proud of hunting and hopes to inspire more women to take part.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Filmmakers said they plan to use the latest digital camera technology as they venture from the planet's ice caps to ocean depths to deserts and remote forest. 'Our Planet' will focus on the Earth's last wilderness areas and the animals living there, the project's British producers said Wednesday. Audiences will have to be patient: The eight-part series will take four years to make and is planned for a 2019 debut for Netflix customers internationally. 'Our Planet' is being produced by U.K.-based Silverback Films in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, an independent conservation group. Silverback company directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, whose credits include 'Frozen Planet' and 'African Cats' as well as 'Planet Earth,' will lead the production. 'We will reveal the most amazing sights on Earth and show them in ways they have never been seen before,' Fothergill and Scholey promised in a statement. The series is intended to wow 'global audiences with the wonder and importance of the natural world,' they said. 'Netflix is proud to be the global home for perhaps Silverback's most ambitious project to date,' said Lisa Nishimura of the streaming firm. This photo provided by Netflix/naturepl.com and WWF-International shows an African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) in front of double rainbow, in Masai Mara, Kenya, included in the Netflix natural history series, 'Our Planet,' in collaboration with Silverback Films and WWF. The eight-part series debuts in 2019. 'The Planet projects have enjoyed great success on Netflix and have helped launch new technologies for viewing at home.' The firm hopes the show will boost usage of its ultra high definition 4K capabilities. 'We think watching Our Planet, fully on demand in 4K will be an unforgettable experience for our members.' World Wildlife Fund is opening its projects in protected areas to Silverback Films and will join with the company to create multimedia storytelling on WWF's website and other platforms. The series will introduce viewers to fragile habitats and 'precious species' and comes at a critical time for global conservation, said Colin Butfield, WWF executive producer. It also demonstrates the growing power of new-wave TV outlets like Netflix, which are claiming turf from traditional broadcast and cable outlets. 'Our Planet' predecessor 'Planet Earth' was created by Silverback for the BBC network in Britain and was a hit for Discovery channel in America when it aired in 2007.\n\n    #Summary#: Netflix will release 'Our Planet' in 4K Ultra HD, which will be an unforgettable experience for viewers. The series will showcase the most amazing sights on Earth, including the planet's ice caps and remote forests. It will be produced in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund and will introduce viewers to precious species living in fragile habitats.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

There is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when I meet Kathryn Beale at her three-bedroom home in Swindon. More scary still, she appears to be drinking it. Fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted, as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice. But I am here because Kathryn is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff, and one very disconcerting product in particular. The 41-year-old mother-of-two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers. Along with some 60 other specialists in this country, she whizzes it into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits. Mothers have reported powerful healing properties, saying that eating their own placenta (the blood-filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb) has helped to increase their milk supply, reduce post-natal bleeding, stabilise blood pressure, and, crucially, provide them with more energy to care for their babies. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Hollywood actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton. Kathryn has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients. Nor, for that matter, has any other practitioner in the 70-strong Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network (IPEN), of which Kathryn is a member. IPEN estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010, the majority in Britain. Yet Kathryn is in despair, having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business, but help put an end to placenta-eating across the country. Scroll down for video. Natural: Kathryn Beale\u00a0whizzes plcenta into smoothies or into pills for women convinced of its health benefits. Swindon Council is claiming that her services pose a danger to the mothers she is trying to help, and are taking her to court saying they want to stop her from trading. They have already taken half her essential kit, including a grinder and a pill-maker, meaning she can no longer provide her service. She said: \u2018It does seem like a witch-hunt. Why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which I believe helps new mothers? Yes, some people might be squeamish about it, but that doesn\u2019t give the council the right to just close me down.\u2019 IPEN director Lynnea Shrief lost her court battle against Dacorum Council in Hertfordshire last year. She believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry. Three other IPEN businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities. Benefits: Mothers say eating placenta has helped to increase their milk supply and reduce post-natal bleeding. Pictured: Placenta capsules. It was in March that the council took action against Kathryn. Health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen \u2013 with the risk of poisoning the mother. Last month, Swindon failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against Kathryn, who contested the order. Despite noting her various food-safety certificates, and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns, the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in May. Kathryn says of the council\u2019s inspection: \u2018It was clear they didn\u2019t know how a maternity ward works. They had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas. It\u2019s just not the case.\u2019 Kathryn provides her clients \u2013 mostly well-educated, professional women \u2013 with a large zip-lock bag into which the placenta is placed. The bagged organ is then put into a large leak-proof plastic box, which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for Kathryn to collect. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Mad Men star January Jones (left) and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton (right) If the mother has requested a \u00a320 placenta smoothie at the birth, Kathryn blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand-held blender. She takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon, ginger and green chilli, or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules. This service costs \u00a3150. Kathryn, a former primary school teacher turned birth \u2018doula\u2019 \u2013 a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers \u2013 became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall flambee one on TV. She added placenta processing to her birth doula business in March 2013 after a day-long IPEN training course. She obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing, infection control, and HACCP, a food safety management system. A Swindon Council spokesman said: \u2018Preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them. We are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers.\u2019 A key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital \u2013 while others just need a day or two in bed. Scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two-year-old French girl who nearly died from the flu. They found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon. Interferon, which is commercially available, helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims. Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Imagine Institute of Genetic Diseases in Paris, and the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in the US, said: \u2018This finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon.\u2019 The girl, who was critically ill with flu in 2011, has not had the virus since, after being vaccinated annually. The researchers\u2019 findings have been published in the journal Science.\n\n    #Summary#: Kathryn Beale, 41, is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff. She whizzes placentas into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for mothers. Mothers have reported powerful healing properties from eating the organ.

For a meager $862,000, its gargoyles, endless balconies and ornate fountains can be yours with which to carry on the eccentric torch of quirky Indy celebrity\u00a0Jerry A. Hostetler. It sprang from inimitable Hostetler's imagination after he went from 24-year-old pimp known to police as Mr. Big to a local mini-magnate. Now, as it sits largely unoccupied, it's a cause for both concern and awe as neighbors wonder how something so immensely unique and bound to its creator can remain among the neighborhood's modest ranchers and middle class homes. Scroll down for video. Went big: Realtors in Indianapolis are looking to unload what's likely the Midwestern city's gaudiest and most famous home--a 26,000 square foot castle built of ranch homes glued together by a former pimp turned construction king. Uncertain future: Hostetler realized his vision, but after he died in 2006 the home became a spectacle when no longer attached to its creator. Currently trying to sell off the home is Indiana-born, Florida-based tech investor Chad Folkening, reports the\u00a0Indy Star. He purchased the home in foreclosure following Hostetler's 2006 death. He listed it for $2.2 million in February 2012. By December 2013, that number had dropped to $1,295,000. Last week, the asking price dropped to $862,000. But the home's newest listing agent is keeping an upbeat attitude.\u00a0'I showed it to two serious buyers last week,' agent Tiff Atkinson told the Star. 'One cannot even begin to describe,' continued Atkinson. 'Lots of architectural design, very private, two or three parking garages.' Started small: Jerry A. Hostetler was once a 24-year-old pimp known to Indianapolis police as Mr. Big. After becoming a local construction mini-mogul, he started buying up the homes around his modest 3-bedroom ranch house. Inventive: The house is actually five garden-variety ranch houses cobbled together to form a 20,000-plus square foot campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool, ballroom and guesthouse. Atkinson and Folkening have envisioned a sort of live-and-work tech startup campus as one use for the home. Atkinson, who works for Carpenter Realtors, sees the perfect home for 'formal and informal gatherings, from small crowds to hundreds of guests.' Starting from a three-bedroom ranch house where he lived since the '60s for a short time with a wife and infant daughter, Hostetler gradually bought up his neighbors' houses. Hostetler, on the other hand, saw a blank canvas on which to splatter his haphazard domestic vision. Steadily grew: He cobbled them together, dug a swimming pool, dug ponds, imported fountains, added ballrooms, added life-size statues of gorillas, added -- of all things -- a stone grotto (into which he installed a hot tub) Spacious: When the banks finally caught up with Hostetler, who'd long ago stopped paying his debts, his sprawling home had grown to 23,000 square feet. The house is actually five garden-variety ranch houses cobbled together to form a 20,000-plus square foot campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool, ballroom and guesthouse. He cobbled them together, dug a swimming pool, dug ponds, imported fountains, added ballrooms, added life-size statues of gorillas, added -- of all things -- a stone grotto (into which he installed a hot tub). Since Hostetler's death in 2006, the house has remained empty, with some of its more outlandish accoutrements - such as a 6-foot mermaid and polar bear statue - sold off. He was 66. In constrast to how he lived, he now rests quite modestly. He was buried in Washington Park East Cemetery, in an unmarked grave. Gaudy:\u00a0Since Hostetler's death in 2006, the house has remained empty, with some of its more outlandish accoutrements - such as a 6-foot mermaid and polar bear statue - sold off. The house is sometimes locally known as the 'pimp house' or 'dolphin mansion'\n\n    #Summary#: The former pimp turned construction king Jerry A. Hostetler built a 26,000-square-foot castle for himself which remains unoccupied after his death in 2006. Realtors are now looking to sell it off for $862,000. The house is notorious for its outlandish decoration and was dubbed \"pimp house\" due to its owner's past. The current owner, a tech investor named Chad Folkening, bought it in foreclosure and has since dropped the price from $2.2 million in 2012 to less than a million now. The house is five garden-variety ranchers glued together to form a campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool, ballroom and guesthouse.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

Dino Maglio, who is on trial in Padua, northern Italy, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Tuesday after the girl reported being drugged and raped while staying at his home. Prosecutors said Maglio spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur the girl was drinking with a tranquilliser pill. Maglio claimed sex with the girl, who was under-age at the time, was consensual but admitted he was \u2018stupid\u2019 to spike her drink. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquilliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Former Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured right) has been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl. Maglio was ordered to pay \u20ac60,000 ($83,000) to the victim and \u20ac15,000 ($20,000) to her mother, who was travelling with her at the time, the Guardian reports. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO) carried out a year-long investigation into Maglio, collecting 14 testimonies from women who claimed they were assaulted by him after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The policeman was accused of using the name of Leon on Couchsurfing.com. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The IRPO\u2019s investigation revealed a man who made himself seem like a fun and fast-living host. Some alleged victims claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. Dino Maglio's Couchsurfing profile page listed his name as Leon Padova and showed his occupation as a policeman. Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term. She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n\n    #Summary#: Dino Maglio has been sentenced to six and a half years in jail. He offered the teen, her mother and her sister a place to stay at his flat. They came into contact with him in Italy via the Couchsurfing website. He spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur the girl was drinking. He admitted drugging the 16-year-old but\u00a0claims the sex was\u00a0consensual. Maglio was ordered to pay $83,000 to the victim and $20,000 to her mother. More than a dozen women have come forward claiming he assaulted them.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The summary claims that Maglio spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur that the girl was drinking, but the original document only mentions that he drugged her with a tranquillizer pill. There is no mention of Baileys liqueur.\n3.

Some 42 per cent of those polled said they supported shale gas extraction, while 35 per cent disagreed with using the controversial technique. The anti-fracking environmental campaign group was accused of trying to bury the inconvenient survey result. More people in Britain back fracking than are opposed to it, a Greenpeace survey has found. The finding \u2013 hidden in a footnote to a Greenpeace press release \u2013 shows greater backing for the shale gas industry than other recent polls. Only 24 per cent of people said they supported fracking in a Department of Energy and Climate Change public attitudes survey published in February. A similar poll by YouGov in January put approval for extracting shale gas at 35 per cent and opposition at 41 per cent. The Greenpeace survey, carried out by ComRes, found greatest support among men (56 per cent) and the over-65s (58 per cent). By contrast only 29 per cent of women backed fracking. The finding \u2013 hidden in a footnote to a Greenpeace press release \u2013 shows greater backing for the shale gas industry than other recent polls. Above, a drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex. Greenpeace activists 'frack' David Cameron's countryside home last year. Above, a man puts up a sign on green barriers. Over 2,000 people marched and surrounded a drill rig by forming a human chain in West Sussex in 2013. Other results of the study suggest the issue could help to swing the result in marginal constituencies at next month's General Election, the campaign group claimed. Nearly a third of people would be less likely to vote for a candidate who supports fracking in their area, the polling found. Only 13 per cent would be more inclined to support them, although 44 per cent said it would have no impact on how they cast their vote. At least 35 of the seats being targeted in the Tories' election strategy are in areas licensed for fracking, as are 11 Labour and eight Lib Dem seats held with a swing of two per cent or less. One in ten Conservative voters, nearly a quarter of Lib-Dem supporters and a fifth of Labour backers said they were 'much less likely' to vote for a candidate in favour of fracking in their constituency. More than 800 people standing to be MPs next month have signed a pledge declaring their opposition to shale gas organised by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Environmental activists locked themselves together at the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site in Balcombe. A camp in Balcombe was set up to protest against plans to drill  for methane gas on a site just outside the village. They include 100 Labour candidates, 105 Lib Dems, 403 Greens, 23 Plaid Cymru, seven SNP and seven Ukip candidates. No Conservatives have added their names so far. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of extracting natural gas from rock deep underground by blasting it with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals. The industry claims it is a safe way of solving the energy crisis and produces fewer greenhouse gases than other fuel-production methods. But campaigners claim the technique poisons water supplies, industrialises the countryside and increases the risk of earthquakes. Ken Cronin, chief executive of fracking industry body UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said: 'This poll \u2013 ironically commissioned by people who oppose fracking \u2013 shows that when presented with the real facts about the safety and low environmental impact of shale gas operations, British people will support onshore oil and gas exploration. 'The poll also shows that 57 per cent people say that a candidate's support for fracking either makes them more likely to vote in their favour or no difference. Greenpeace's own facts simply do not support their rhetoric on fracking.' A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'It's odd for the fracking industry to be welcoming these latest figures. Compared to a similar survey from a year ago, public support for fracking has actually fallen. 'Even Tory voters say they are more likely to vote for a candidate opposing fracking in their constituencies than for someone who's in favour of it. 'The government and the fracking lobby have thrown the kitchen sink at propping up dwindling public backing for this risky industry, and they have very little to show for it.'\n\n    #Summary#: More people support fracking than opposing it in the UK, according to a recent Greenpeace survey. The anti-fracking environmental campaign group was criticized for hiding the inconvenient survey result in a footnote of their press release. The poll shows that 58 per cent of women disagree with using the controversial technique, while 56 per cent of men support shale gas extraction. The survey also suggests that candidates who support fracking are more likely to lose votes than gain them. Despite the result of the survey, the technique continues to be a safe way of solving the energy crisis and produces fewer greenhouse gases than other fuel-production methods.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The summary states that \"More people support fracking than opposing it in the UK,\" which is not entirely accurate. While the Greenpeace survey did find that 42% of respondents supported shale gas extraction, it also found that 35% disagreed with using the controversial technique. This means that support for fracking is not necessarily stronger than opposition to it.\n2. The summary implies that the Greenpeace survey was attempting to hide the inconvenient survey result, which may not be true. While the survey's finding was indeed buried in a footnote of the press release, it's possible that this was done for legitimate reasons rather than to deliberately conceal the information.\n3. The summary states that the poll shows that 58% of women disagree with using the controversial technique, while 56% of men support shale gas extraction. However, the original article does not mention anything about gender differences in opinions towards fracking. This information may have been fabricated or exaggerated.\n4. The summary suggests that candidates who support fracking are more likely to lose votes than gain them, but the original article does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, the article quotes a statement from Ken Cronin, CEO of fracking industry body UK Onshore Oil and Gas, saying that the poll shows that when presented with the real facts about the safety and low environmental impact of shale gas operations, British people will support onshore oil and gas exploration. This contradicts the summary's assertion that supporting fracking will lead to lost votes.\n5. Finally, the summary concludes by stating that despite the result of the survey, the technique continues to be a safe way of solving the energy crisis and produces fewer greenhouse gases than other fuel-production methods. This is a subjective opinion and not necessarily supported by scientific evidence.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the summary contains some non-factual information and hallucinations, and it's important to carefully consider the source of the information and evaluate the evidence before coming to any conclusions."

Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of  police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a \"small group of agitators intervened.\" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. \"We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,\" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice.\" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, \"No justice, no peace\" and \"All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times.\" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. \"We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,\" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete.\" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday.

And boss Tim Cook is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device. Any employee working in the regions where the watch is being launched - including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan - will be eligible. Scroll down for video. Any employee working in the regions where the Watch is being launched - including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan - will be eligible for a 50% discount on the standard model (centre) and the Sport model (left). It does not apply to the Edition model (right) The plans were in a memo leaked to Apple fansite 9to5Mac in which Mr Cook wrote: 'I know that many of you have been looking forward to choosing an Apple Watch for yourselves, and we want to make it easy for you. 'Starting Friday a special Employee Purchase Plan will offer a 50% discount on any Apple Watch or Apple Watch Sport for your personal use.' Notably, the discount doesn't apply to the expensive Edition model, which starts at $10,000 in the US and \u00a38,000 in the UK. Mr Cook continued that as the Watch is introduced in more countries, this price plan will be extended. Prices for the Sport model start at $349 in the US and \u00a3299 in the UK, while the stainless steel Watch starts at $549 (\u00a3479). Apple's Watch goes on display around the world on 10 April and people can pre-order it at 12.01 Pacific Time (8am BST) on this day. The Watch will then  go on general sale on 24 April in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan. Earlier this week, Apple released the first four guided tour videos of its watch, and said more are 'coming soon.' These videos (pictured) include an introduction to the main features, plus how to use the Messages app, customise the face, and use digital touch. This means US employees will only pay $174.50 and $274 respectively, while in the UK the price drops to \u00a3149.50 and \u00a3239.50. Like many firms, Apple staff already reportedly receive a discount across the product range and this is said to be around 30 per cent. According Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster, Apple will sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale, three times the first-day sales of Apple's last all-new product, the iPad. It would put the Apple Watch behind Apple's first iPad, which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010, but ahead of the first iPhone, which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007. However, it would be a fraction of the 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses sold in the same timespan. The half-price Watch discounts apply from Friday and will last for 90 days. It is not clear whether employees can buy multiple watches under the scheme and Apple has refused to comment. Mr Cook added: 'Congratulations to everyone who has worked to help this product reach our customers. 'And thanks in advance to the thousands of retail employees around the world who will start placing it on people's wrists starting Friday.' Although going on display in stores this weekend, the Apple Watch won't go on sale generally until the 24 April. Although it could be seen as a way to boost sales, Ernest Doku telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline the plans will benefit customers:\u00a0'Apple knows it's wading into unchartered territory with a costly, and as yet unproven, device. 'What better way to instill the idea the Watch is a must-have accessory than offer deep discounts for its biggest evangelists? The videos also give an overview of how to see more options by pressing the screen. These options change depending on the app being used.\u00a0For instance, when working out, it lets a wearer stop the workout. The left-hand image shows how the digital crown can be used to select from a list of emoticons. The right-hand image shows the crown being used to select contacts after the button on the side has been pressed. 'It means those on the front line have actual experience they can draw on when making sales, and a stronger narrative for prospective buyers.'

Earlier this week, Apple released the first four guided tour videos of its watch, and said more are 'coming soon.'\n\n    #Summary#: Apple has announced that they will be giving away free Apple Watches to all of their employees as a reward for their hard work. It is not known whether this offer will be extended to the general public.

However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video. Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped. She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.' Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home. She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require \u00a34000 for her return. Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick. She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing. At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want \u00a34000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.' At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.\n\n    #Summary#: A teenager in the UK, Lily Sharp, went too far with her prank on her mother by faking her own kidnapping and demanding a ransom from her mother. Despite her mother's panic and anger, Lily's Twitter post of the prank gained 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favorites.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona\u2019s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night. Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night. Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9. Subs not used:\u00a0Bravo, Bartra, Adriano, Rafinha. Goals: Neymar 14, 34. PSG: Sirigu 6; Van der Wiel 3.5, Marquinhos 4.5, Luiz 5, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6, Cabaye 4 (Lucas Moura 66, 6.5), Matuidi 6 (Rabiot 80, 6); Cavani 4 (Lavezzi 80, 6.5), Ibrahimovic 4.5, Pastore 3. Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves\u2019 cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG\u2019s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca\u2019s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar\u2019s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant \u2013 to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered. Barcelona star Lionel Messi is reunited with his former Nou Camp teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic before kick-off on Tuesday night. Neymar tucks the ball past PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu to give Barcelona the lead after just 14 minutes. Neymar celebrates with Andres Iniesta after the Spain and Barcelona star had slid him through for the opening goal. Gerard Pique (left) joins in the celebrations after Barcelona had taken a 4-1 aggregate lead to relieve any pressure on them. Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins. PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique\u2019s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn\u2019t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca\u2019s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi. Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best. Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side\u2019s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6. Neymar celebrates scoring his second goal of the night to put Barcelona 5-1 up on aggregate to set up a semi-final place. Neymar chats with Messi after the second goal as Barca look ahead to next month's semi-final.\n\n    #Summary#: Barcelona through to Champions League semi-finals after 5-1 aggregate win over Paris Saint-Germain.

Tyrus Byrd, 40, was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the departure of the majority of the police force, the city attorney, clerk and\u00a0water treatment supervisor. The officials all cited 'safety concerns' in their resignation letters, the outgoing mayor says. There are 713 people living in the community and, according to the US Census Bureau, 57percent are white and 41percent are black. Unwelcome change: Tyrus Byrd, who was sworn in as mayor last week, must find replacements for five of the city's six police officers, the city attorney, the city clerk and the water treatment supervisor. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in last Wednesday, told Daily Mail Online she still doesn't know why the employees quit - though the outgoing mayor says they cited 'safety concerns' in their resignations. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in on Wednesday, told the Daily Mail Online on Sunday that she is still not sure why the city employees quit. Her father, former city board member Simon Wofford, insists his daughter has a good relationship with the police department. KFVS-TV\u00a0broke the story last week. Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had. 'I think it was pretty dirty the way they all quit without giving her a chance, but I don't think they hurt the town with quitting because who needs six police for 740 people?' resident Martha Miller told KFVS. The run-down city, which is 175 miles south of St. Louis in southeastern Missouri, has suffered a spate of break-ins recently. Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first\u00a0African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees. Randall Ramsey, the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job, told the Daily Mail Online he also has no idea why the group quit. Tyrus Byrd (right) was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the reported departure of the majority of the police force, the city's attorney, clerk and water treatment supervisor. Randall Ramsey, (pictured center with a past City Board) the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job over two terms, told the Daily Mail Online he has no idea why the group quit. The new mayor's father Simon Wofford (far right), who was defeated in the election for his seat, says she had a good relationship with the force. He added that most of the officers are part time and work for\u00a0other towns in the surrounding area. He told KFVS that the officers cited 'safety concerns' when they resigned. Barry Aycock, who has served as an alderman, told the Daily Mail Online the election and the consequences are the same as usual and he hardly sees the police out on patrol. He added there is little crime in the city, aside from a\u00a0spate or burglaries in recent weeks. There are around 700 people living in the community (Broad Street pictured) and, according to a 2010 US Census Bureau, 57 per cent are white and 41 per cent are black.\n\n    #Summary#: The election of Tyrus Byrd as the new mayor of Parma, Missouri resulted in the departure of five out of six police officers, city attorney, clerk, and water treatment supervisor. The employees' resignations were attributed to the rising crime rate in the city. Despite this, Parma residents have expressed their support for Mayor Byrd, emphasizing the need for change in the city's law enforcement.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

A City high flier jumped \u2018feet first\u2019 in front of a train after leaving his job at an investment management company to spend more time with his family, an inquest heard today. Jay Kantaria, 38, from Harrow, north-west London, had been looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party when he leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill. But a coroner recorded an open verdict on the cause of death, saying there was 'doubt' as to Mr Kantaria's intention when he jumped as a train passed through the station last October. North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told the businessman had \u2018recently\u2019 left his senior position at Baring Asset Management to start a career in property development. The London School of Economics graduate died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 and had to be identified from his fingerprints. Coroner Andrew Walker expressed his \u2018deepest sympathies\u2019 to Mr Kantaria\u2019s 37-year-old wife, Monica, and his surviving family. He said Nairobi-born Mr Kantaria had worked as the chairman's assistant at Baring, but had decided to become a property developer. The coroner said the cause of death was \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019, consistent with being struck by a rapidly-moving train. Mr Kantaria had no alcohol or drugs in his system and did not suffer from any known psychiatric problems, Mr Walker added. Location: Mr Kantaria leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill (above) in north-west London. Train driver Michael Hughes recounted how Mr Kantaria \u2018seemed to have a good look at my train\u2019. Mr Hughes said in a statement: \u2018I then lost sight of him. When I passed the bridge I saw who I believe to be the same male run to the edge of the platform and jump feet-first.' He added that he felt no impact but immediately activated the emergency brake and called for help. Detective Constable Terry Hancocks from British Transport Police said: \u2018The line speed was 100mph. He [Mr Hughes] was travelling at about 85mph\u2019. The investigator said Mr Kantaria \u2018appears to move from the platform... and then he is caught by the camera just in the air, before being struck by the train\u2019. The coroner advised Mr Kantaria\u2019s family not to view stills from the CCTV footage. Scene: The businessman died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 at the station (seen from above) Mr Hancocks said: \u2018I did speak to Mrs Kantaria. The gentleman had just given up his job to spend more time with his wife and children and it was completely, completely out of character. As far as the family are concerned, it was completely out of the blue.\u2019 When the coroner indicated he was ready to record the death as a suicide, Mrs Kantaria, a senior auditor at JP Morgan Chase, said: \u2018He had everything to live for. 'He was looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party the following week. There is no reason I have to believe that he intended his life to come to an end.\u2019 The coroner replied: \u2018In the circumstances, I think there is a doubt in my mind about what his intention was, so I am going to leave the conclusion open. Jay Kantaria jumped in front of a train at Sudbury Hill station and died. 'The conclusion, for the reason I have said, is an open conclusion. There is no evidence to suggest he was at risk of bringing his life to an end. He had everything to live for and it just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense.\u2019 Mr Kantaria had also worked at Wellington Management and Halbis CapitalManagement - and had strengths in \u2018communication and relationship management\u2019, according to his Linkedin profile.\n\n    #Summary#: Jay Kantaria, 38, leapt onto tracks at Sudbury Hill station in NW London. He had recently left investment firm to start property development career. Family say he had 'everything to live for' and death was 'out of the blue' Coroner records open verdict as case 'just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense'\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

        "res": " Based on the information provided, I would say that the summary does contain some non-factual or hallucinated information. Here's why:\n\n* The summary states that Jay Kantaria \"leapt onto tracks at Sudbury Hill station in NW London.\" However, the document states that he actually jumped \"feet-first\" in front of a train at the station. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have embellished or altered the facts slightly.\n* The summary implies that Mr. Kantaria's decision to leave his job at an investment firm and start a career in property development was a recent change. However, the document does not provide any specific timeline or details regarding when exactly he made this transition. Therefore, the summary's claim that he had \"recently\" left his old job may be an exaggeration or misinterpretation.\n* The summary quotes the coroner as saying that there was \"doubt\" as to Mr. Kantaria's intention when he jumped onto the tracks. However, the document does not mention anything about the coroner expressing such doubts. Instead, it simply reports that the coroner recorded an open verdict, citing a lack of evidence to support any conclusions about Mr. Kantaria's intentions. Thus, the summary seems to have taken some creative liberties with the wording of the coroner's statements.\n* Finally, the summary states that Mr. Kantaria had a background in \"communication and relationship management\" according to his LinkedIn profile. While this may indeed be true, the document does not provide any confirmation or proof of this fact, making it somewhat uncertain whether it should be considered accurate or relevant to the story.\n\nTherefore, while the summary generally accurately reflects the key points of the document, it appears to contain certain minor inconsistencies and potentially misleading language that could be interpreted as hallucinations or non-factual elements."

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video. Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone. Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment. Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords. Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor. 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'\n\n    #Summary#: A mechanic at Halfords in Plymouth was caught joyriding in a customer's car thanks to the customer's dashcam. The mechanic was said to be doing just under twice the speed limit at 57mph in a 30mph zone.

Now genetic research has revealed that ancient European populations were dark skinned for far longer than had originally been thought. Rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from Africa  around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight, these first Homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour. Scroll down for video. This graphic above shows the influx of genes to Europe that brought lighter skin colour and taller body shapes, according to the new research on ancient human remains conducted by geneticists at Harvard University. Genetic analysis has shown that hunter gatherers living in Spain up to 8,500 years ago still had dark skin. It was not until 7,800 years ago, when the first farmers migrated from the Near East through Turkey that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared. DNA analysis obtained from ancient human remains has shown that as these farmers bred with the dark skinned hunter gatherers, one of these genes became prevalent in the European population and European's skin colour began to lighten. Around 5,800 years ago the second gene, which makes skin colour lighter still, also began to spread though the European population. The first Europeans looked dramatically different to most of the fair skinned people that live there today. New research suggests Caucasians were a recent addition to the area, arriving on the continent 8,000 years ago. Europeans had dark skin for far longer than previously though. Photographed are two participants in the BBC's Trading Races where members of the British public spent several days dressed with a different skin colour. The research, which was presented at the 84th annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, shows that populations in Europe were still evolving until relatively recently. It also shows that a population of hunter gatherers living on the site of Motala, southern Sweden, had already developed both skin-lightening genes around 7,700 years ago together with a third that gave them blue eyes. Dr Iain Mathieson, a geneticist at Harvard University in Massachusetts who led the work, said: 'Ancient DNA makes it possible to examine populations as they were before, during and after adaptation events, and thus to reveal the tempo and mode of selection. A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests. Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory. the samples were dated from 5,700 BC to 800 BC, ranging across the Stone, Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages. 'Our findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation as hunter and gatherers and non-local farmers intermarried, but surprisingly no presence of increased lactose persistence or tolerance to lactose,' said Professor Ron Pinhasi, from University College Dublin's Earth Institute. 'This means that these ancient Europeans would have had domesticated animals like cows, goats and sheep, but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals.' 'We find a surprise in seven Scandinavian hunter-gatherers from the Motala site in southern Sweden who lived around 7,700 years before present. 'While the western hunter-gatherers of central and southern Europe largely have the ancestral allele at the two major European skin pigmentation loci, the closely related Scandinavian hunter-gatherers have both the derived alleles contributing to light skin pigmentation at high frequency.' The study, which is also published on the open access site BioRxiv, compared the genomes obtained from the remains of 83 people found at archaeological sites across Europe along with the genomes of modern Europeans. The researchers found five genes associated with changes in diet, body size and skin pigmentation that underwent natural selection in the past 8,000 years. Studies suggest that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe.\u00a0Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe. Two of the genes were associated with producing light skin - SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. They found that the remains of early hunter gatherers who lived in Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary around 8,500 years ago, they lacked these key gene variants. However, in the remains of hunter gatherers that had lived in Motala 7,700 years ago, they carried both variants of SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 that produced lighter skin. They also carried another gene known to produce blue eyes in Europeans. Surprisingly they found a fourth set of genes in the DNA from these people suggests these people may actually have been related to people living in East Asia at the time. Dr Mathieson and his colleagues also found that when the first farmers from the Near East arrived in Europe, they carried with them genes for light skin. At this time the SLC24A5 gene quickly became prevalent in southern and central European populations and then around 5,800 years ago. Previous research has identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe. These gene is known to account for between 25-40 per cent of the skin tone lightening in Europeans. Around 5,800 years ago the gene variant for SLC45A1 then becomes prevalent, lightening skin colour further. The results contradict the traditional view that lower sunlight levels in Europe would have favoured lighter skin. The study also showed that around around 4,800 years ago a group of herders known as the Yamnaya migrated from the stepps between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, carried with them genes for tallness to northern and central Europe. Professor Chris Stringer, a leading anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said: 'This research adds yet more surprises to the remarkable complexity of population relationships in prehistoric Europe being uncovered through ancient DNA. 'Archaeologists had thought that Europe showed a relatively simple succession from hunter-gatherers in the Mesolithic to early farmers in the Neolithic, with the basic assumption that the arrival of farming significantly altered the biology of those first farmers, after which they gradually developed into the Europeans of today. 'But from ancient DNA it now looks like the first farmers in mainland Europe were still relatively dark-skinned and dark-eyed, and lacked the ability to digest milk properly until only about 4,000 years ago, while contemporary hunter-gatherers in Scandinavia may have been lighter-skinned but with a surprising frequency of a gene found in oriental populations today, suggesting they would have resembled them in hair form and the distinctive morphology of their front teeth. 'Ongoing selection, for poorly understood reasons, seems to have maintained large stature in northern Europe after the arrival of farming, while progressively reducing it in southern Europe, especially Iberia.' Dr Nina Jablonski, a paleoanthropologist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in the research, told the journal Science: \u00a0'What we thought was a fairly simple picture of the emergence of de-pigmented skin in Europe is an exciting patchwork of selection as populations disperse into northern latitudes. 'This data is fun because it shows how much recent evolution has taken place.'\n\n    #Summary#: The original migrants to Europe from Africa arrived 40,000 years ago. Up until 8,000 years ago, early hunter-gatherers largely had darker skin. When Near East farmers arrived, they carried with them light skin genes. Genomes of 83 people found 5 genes linked with diet and skin changes.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga. The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike. Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria. Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals. Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes. Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar. Booked: Mascherano. Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed. Booke: Casado. Some grumbled that Almeria\u2019s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Juli\u00e1n Cuesta in the visitors\u2019 goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Bar\u00e7a number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria\u2019s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi\u2019s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta\u2019s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta\u2019s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Bar\u00e7a and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo\u2019s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta\u2019s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes. Almeria keeper\u00a0Julian Cuesta uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez (left) Barcelona stalwart Xavi (right) watches on as team-mate Messi tries a rare attempt using his head. Spain international Pedro (centre) was given an opportunity after Neymar was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule. Everyone on the pitch can only watch as Messi's stunning left-foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead. The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far. Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria\u2019s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona\u2019s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona\u2019s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don\u2019t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats. Former France and Barcelona defender Eric Abidal (centre) was at the Nou Camp to watch his old team. Suarez takes a leaf from Messi's book by cutting in from the right before unleashing a stunning left-footed shot. Goalscorers Suarez and Messi embrace after taking a 2-0 lead on 55minutes at the Nou Camp. Suarez leaps into Messi's arms after the pair's sensational opening strikes put the hosts in control. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who was coming up against former team-mate in Almeria manager Sergi Barjuan, instructs his team. Young defender Bartra (left) heads home at the far post to stretch Barcelona's lead to 3-0 going into the final 15minutes. Veteran midfielder Xavi stumbles under pressure from Almeria players as Barcelona look to see out the game. Suarez wheels away after tapping in his second from close range in injury time to complete the 4-0 rout. The Uruguay international thanks winger Pedro for finding him with the cross for Barcelona's final goal.\n\n    #Summary#: Lionel Messi scored a brace as Barcelona defeated Almeria in a La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp. Messi's first goal came in the 8th minute, with the second coming half an hour later. Luis Suarez added to the tally with a well-taken goal after a delightful solo run, leaving the defense chasing shadows. Barca defender Gerard Pique scored with a powerful header in the second half. With this victory, Barcelona has moved seven points ahead of Real Madrid in the league table.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video. Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant. Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom. The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail. An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna. Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations. This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in. Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations. 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic. The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at \u00a33.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list. The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings. Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations. She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'\n\n    #Summary#: Millie Marotta's book, Animal Kingdom, features detailed line illustrations. The \u00a33.99 book is currently #1 on Amazon's Top 100 Books list. The 36-year-old illustrator resides and works in Tenby, Wales.\n\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

The Marshall County Board voted last week to send a bill for $76,000 to the Peoria Republican who resigned last month after questions about his extravagant government-funded spending. The letter seeks a check or a promise from Schock that he will pay for this summer's special and general election costs. County officials estimate each will run about $38,000. Former Illinois Congressional representative Aaron Schock, 33, is facing calls to pay for the special election to replace him after resigning from the House last month amid an expenses scandal. The four-term Congressman (left) attracted scrutiny for his lavish lifestyle, including many selfies with celebrities such as Ariana Grande (right), after  a Downton Abbey-style renovation to his Washington office. A Schock spokesman did not respond to an emailed request from The Associated Press seeking comment to the board's letter. His campaign fund balance is $3.3 million,\u00a0The  Journal-Star reported. 'Schock has more money than the county has in its reserves,' Marshall County State's Attorney Paul Bauer said. Once seen as a media-savvy rising star in the Republican Party, Schock, 33, made appearances on Top Chef, the Colbert Report and the cover of Men's Health magazine. However, the four-term Congressman's celebrity lifestyle attracted examination of his spending habits. Earlier this year it was discovered that his office had received a $40,000 renovation funded by the taxpayer to make it look like the Edwardian Era homes on Downton Abbey. It has a crystal chandeliers and pheasant feathers in addition to its elaborately decorated furniture and bright red walls. The Republican had been viewed as a rising star in his party after a slate of media appearances including the cover of Men's Health. The extravagance of Schock's Washington office, which included pheasant feathers and a crystal chandelier, was what first drew attention to his spending. The Illinois representative originally replied to the reports by saying 'haters gonna hate'. But further investigations revealed that he took a private jet to watch an NFL game in Chicago and had spent $10,000 taking a group including his interns to a Katy Perry concert. Schock also failed to report expenditures on trips abroad, required by Congressional rules. Though he hired a high powered defense and public relations team, Schock resigned after a report from POLITICO\u00a0about misrepresentations of the mileage on his publicly-funded car. He has repaid the government for his office and mileage, and his resignation likely helped him avoid an ethics inquiry into his luxury lifestyle. Shock's district now faces the task of putting together a quick election to put a representative back in Washington. A copy of the Marshall County letter went to the other 20 election jurisdictions in the 18th Congressional District, some of whom may follow the message's example. Schock (pictured with Pope Francis) is facing a federal investigation into his spending after reports about misrepresented mileage on his car and taxpayer-funded trips on a private jet. 'There are other counties who are interested, and they're kind of waiting on someone to step forward,' Marshall County Board Chairman Gary Kroeschen said. Tazewell County officials expect to pay about $200,000 for the elections and County Board Chairman David Zimmerman said a committee will discuss the issue April 22. The board could act as soon as the end of the month with the special primary election approaching in July, followed by the general election in September. Zimmerman said he hopes other counties follow Marshall's lead. The Justice Department is investigating whether Schock broke any laws with his spending.\n\n    #Summary#: Former congressperson Aaron Schock's district in Illinois is in need of a replacement and a new special election will be held in July and September. Reports say that Schock's office had been modeled after the Edwardian decor of Downton Abbey and that Schock spent around $10,000 to attend a Katy Perry concert with his interns. Schock is also said to have taken a private jet to watch an NFL game in Chicago, according to congressional rules. The Marshall County Board voted last week to send a bill for $76,000 to Schock to pay for the upcoming special and general election costs, and other counties are interested in doing the same.\n    #Your Judgement#: [your judgement]",

        "res": " Based on the information provided, I would say that the summary does contain non-factual or hallucinated information. Here are some examples:\n\n* The summary mentions that Schock's office was modeled after the Edwardian decor of Downton Abbey, but the document does not mention anything about the office's decor.\n* The summary states that Schock spent $10,000 to attend a Katy Perry concert with his interns, but the document only mentions that he took a private jet to watch an NFL game in Chicago and failed to report expenditures on trips abroad. There is no mention of a Katy Perry concert.\n* The summary claims that Schock is said to have taken a private jet to watch an NFL game in Chicago, but the document does not mention anything about a private jet.\n* The summary implies that Schock is under investigation for breaking laws with his spending, but the document only mentions that there is a federal investigation into his spending and that he has repaid the government for his office and mileage.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary contains non-factual or hallucinated information. Therefore, my judgment is \"Yes\"."
