Introduction: The speaker starts by mentioning that people are struggling with anxiety, stress, and sadness. We've heard that happiness is the absence of something (a job, a relationship, etc.), but the speaker disagrees, as true happiness is when you align with purpose and meaning.\n2. Purpose: We are all here for a purpose, and the speaker believes that the reason people are struggling in today's world is because they've lost touch with that purpose. We must find that connection, which will bring us inner peace and happiness.\n3. Meaning: Meaning is something we create, not find. The world is not a meaningless place\u2014instead, we create meaning in our own lives by being creators rather than victims, doing things for others, and having a sense of belonging and contribution to the world.\n4. Finding happiness: Happiness can be found by aligning with our purpose and creating meaning for ourselves. When we do something for others without expectation of anything in return, we feel a deep sense of joy and happiness.\n5. Examples: The speaker shares a story about a man who, after being diagnosed with a terminal illness, continued to help others until his dying day, spreading joy and happiness. The speaker also talks about a time when he was lost, and an old man directed him to his destination simply because he wanted to help.\n6. Conclusion: The talk ends with a reminder that the world is not perfect, and we must find our own joy and meaning in the chaos. The key is to align with purpose and create meaning for ourselves.\n\nThese points aim to inspire listeners to find happiness and fulfillment by focusing on creating meaning and contributing to society, rather", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9931063055992126}]}, {"prompt": "How many followers does Barack Obama have on Twitter right now?\n", "res": "I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide real-time information as my training only goes up until September 2021, and my knowledge cutoff is in 2021.

DeVellis, III\nThe US Supreme Court recently held in Hughes v. United States that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered when a person is confronted with an accusation that would support a criminal prosecution. This decision resolves a circuit split over when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered in a civil case.\nIn Hughes, the defendant was represented by counsel when he agreed to plead guilty to two counts of failing to pay over employment taxes to the government. However, after his sentencing, the government moved to restructure his fines, resulting in a bill of over $7 million. The government then indicted the defendant on 68 counts of failure to pay over employment taxes, and the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had already been sentenced for the same conduct.\nThe Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered when a person is confronted with an accusation that would support a criminal prosecution. The Court reasoned that if the government has already restructured a defendant\u2019s fines or sought to indict him for the same conduct after he has already been sentenced, this is the functional equivalent of a prosecution and triggers the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nThis decision resolves a split among the courts of appeal, which had held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach in a civil case where a defendant is not facing a criminal prosecution.

Mertz\nDharma Publishing / Penguin\nISBN: 978-1-93229-542-5 / 978-0-87773-170-1\nReview by John S. Hatch\nThe Bhagavad Gita is one of the most revered and influential religious texts of Hinduism, written more than 2,500 years ago. It has been translated and interpreted in countless ways over the centuries, but the essence of its teachings remains the same.\nDavid R. Mertz, a scholar of comparative religion and Hinduism, has produced a new translation of the Bhagavad Gita that is both accessible and thought-provoking. He also includes an introduction that provides context for the poem, notes that explain the Sanskrit terms and other references, and an afterword that discusses the relevance of the Gita in contemporary society.\nMertz's translation is a departure from the traditional versions, which are heavily metaphorical and often cryptic. He has tried to retain the original meaning of the Sanskrit while using more everyday language that reads more like a poem than a religious text. The language is beautiful and evocative, which helps to convey the deep wisdom and philosophy of the Gita.\nOne of the unique features of the Gita is its depiction of the struggle between the material and spiritual worlds. The protagonist, Arjuna, is faced with the dilemma of whether or not to participate in a battle that will result in the death of his kin. Mertz cleverly parallels Arjuna's predicament with the challenges that we all face in our own lives, such as grief, anger, and fear. He shows us how we can confront these challenges with equanimity and detachment, which are key teachings of the Gita.\nMertz's interpretation of the Gita is also grounded in the context of its time, which was a period of political upheaval and social change. The Gita talks about war, power, and hierarchy, but it also emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and action.

Since then, the international community has closely monitored the deal\u2019s implementation and its impact on the regional security landscape.\nThe nuclear deal was a significant achievement in international diplomacy and a victory for moderation and peaceful resolution of disputes. It was also a manifestation of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the international community on issues of global concern.\nThe nuclear deal was an essential step toward resolving the international community\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear program and reducing tensions in the region. It effectively prevented Iran from developing nuclear weapons and significantly reduced the risk of a wider conflict in the region.\nUnder the terms of the nuclear deal, Iran subjected its nuclear program to intrusive inspections and controls by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which helped build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThe nuclear deal also provided a framework for dialogue and cooperation between Iran and the international community on a wide range of issues, including nuclear non-proliferation, regional security, and economic cooperation.\nThe nuclear deal has had a positive impact on the Iranian economy, as international sanctions have been lifted, and businesses have been able to resume trade with Iran. This has created new opportunities for investment, infrastructure development, and job creation, and has contributed to the Iranian people\u2019s well-being.\nHowever, the nuclear deal has faced challenges and criticism. Some countries, particularly the US, have sought to undermine and violate the deal, and have imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, threatening the deal\u2019s long-term prospects.\nDespite these challenges, the nuclear deal remains important for promoting peace and security in the region. It is an essential part of the international non-proliferation regime and a testament to the possibilities of diplomacy and cooperation.\nAs we look to the future, it is essential that all parties to the nuclear deal continue to uphold their obligations and work together to ensure its continued implementation and the preservation of peace and stability in the region.", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9944381713867188}]}, {"prompt": "What did I have for breakfast this morning?\n", "res": "I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your personal information or memory.

Can CQRS be used in cases where events are too expensive to store? If so, how do you implement this?\n2. In Event Sourcing, the event stream is the primary source of truth. But can you have multiple event sourcing systems that maintain the same state? If so, how do you ensure they are consistent?\n3. Regarding CQRS, can it be used with a monolithic architecture? If so, how would the command and query layers be implemented?\n4. How do you implement event sourcing in a distributed setting with a cluster of servers? How do you handle write operations and ensure data consistency?\n\nAnswering these questions will help me understand better the principles and ideas behind CQRS and Event Sourcing.\n\nAnswering these questions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!\n\nAnswer 1: Yes, you can store less expensive events with the same level of integrity. You can implement a form of CQRS-lite where you discard some event details or aggregate them into a single event with less details. The most common way is to store audit events that summarize the changes made to entities.\nAnswer 2: Yes, you can have multiple event sourcing systems that maintain the same state. When you have multiple systems, you have a \"system of systems\" and communication between them must be managed. The most common way to ensure consistency is to use a consistent hashing algorithm, so if a change is made to an entity in one system, the event will be automatically sent to all other systems. This way, each system will maintain its state in sync with the others.\nAnswer 3: CQRS can be used with a monolithic architecture. In this case, the command and query layers are part of the same application. You can have a separate context for each layer. One way to implement CQRS in a monolithic architecture is to define commands in a service and queries in another service.\nAnswer 4: Event sourcing in a distributed setting is challenging, but it can be done.

As a result, the need for environmentally sustainable development has become increasingly important. Urban environments have a significant impact on the natural systems and are responsible for a significant portion of the environmental impacts. Therefore, urban planning has a critical role in promoting environmentally sustainable development.\n\nUrban planning involves the process of designing and managing the built and natural environments of cities. It includes the development of land use plans, transportation plans, infrastructure plans, and environmental protection plans. The goal of urban planning is to create sustainable and livable cities with efficient use of resources and minimizing negative impacts on the environment.\n\nOne of the key principles of sustainable urban development is to promote compact development, where developers create high-density residential and commercial areas in central business districts and near public transportation hubs. This reduces the need for individual automobiles and promotes the use of public transportation, reducing the amount of energy used for transportation. Compact development also promotes the development of green spaces, such as parks and community gardens.\n\nGreen infrastructure is another important principle of sustainable urban development. This involves the use of natural systems, such as parks and green spaces, to provide essential services for the urban community. Green infrastructure provides natural water retention, filtration, and purification, reducing the need for expensive and energy-intensive processes such as sewage treatment. It also promotes biodiversity and provides opportunities for recreation and physical activity.\n\nSustainable urban development also involves the use of renewable energy sources. This includes solar, wind, and geothermal energy, which can be used to power buildings and communities. Renewable energy sources reduce the dependence on non-renewable energy sources, such as coal and oil, and help to mitigate the effects of climate change. Sustainable urban development also involves the development of low-impact buildings, such as buildings with highly efficient insulation and natural ventilation, and the use of materials with low embodied energy, such as recycled or locally sourced materials.\n\nFinally, sustainable urban development involves the development of communities that encourage walking,", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.9621731042861938}]}, {"prompt": "Did the package I'm expecting arrive at my doorstep while I've been talking to you?\n", "res": "I'm sorry, I cannot access real-time information about your doorstep or detect if a package arrived while you were talking to me.

(Video)\nApril 6, 2010 by Dustin Baker\t1 Comment\nIn scrum, a scope is a set of features or requirements that define what work is included in the sprint backlog. It represents the goals that the development team is working toward during the sprint. The scope is defined at the sprint planning meeting and serves as the basis for deciding what work is done during the sprint. The scope is often described in terms of the user stories or features that will be implemented. The team estimates the effort required to complete each item in the scope, and then adds up the total effort to determine how much work can be completed in the sprint.\nIn this video, I explain what a scope is in scrum and how it is defined at the sprint planning meeting.\nCategories: Scrum, Software Development | Tags: agile, scrum, scope, Sprint Planning, User Stories | Permalink.\nOne thought on \u201cWhat is a Scope in Scrum?
