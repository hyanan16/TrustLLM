There are several significant cybersecurity threats currently impacting Internet traffic. Here are some of the most notable ones:\n\n1. Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread, with high-profile attacks on organizations like the City of Atlanta, the Colorado Department of Transportation, and the Texas Municipal League.\n2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: A DDoS attack involves overwhelming a network or website with traffic until it becomes unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be launched using botnets, which are networks of compromised devices that are controlled by attackers. DDoS attacks can cause significant financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of services.\n3. Phishing: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers impersonate a trustworthy entity in order to trick victims into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details. Phishing attacks can be carried out through emails, text messages, or even phone calls.\n4. Cryptojacking: Cryptojacking is a type of attack where attackers install malware on a victim's device to secretly mine cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking attacks can cause significant resource drain on the victim's device, leading to reduced performance or even complete failure.\n5. Supply chain attacks: Supply chain attacks involve compromising a trusted third-party vendor or supplier in order to gain access to a target organization's network. Attackers can implant malware or backdoors in software updates or other legitimate software packages, allowing them to access sensitive information or carry out attacks from within the network.\n6. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are sophisticated cyberattacks that are carried out by highly skilled and well-resourced attackers.
