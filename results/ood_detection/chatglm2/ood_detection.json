They were introduced by the famous physicist Max Planck in the early 1900s and are still an active area of research in the field of physics.\n\nQuantum physics is often described as a theory of the\u6781\u81f4 small, where the fundamental principles of the universe are described in terms of probability and angular momentum rather than in terms of position and momentum. This means that the way that particles behave is determined by the state of the universe, rather than by the specific position of the particle itself.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum physics is the wave-particle duality, which states that particles and waves are not mutually exclusive and can exist simultaneously. Another key principle is the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely you know the position of a particle, the less precisely you know its momentum.\n\nQuantum physics also introduces the concept of superposition, which states that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Additionally, it introduces the idea of entanglement, which states that two particles can be connected in a way that allows them to affect each other\\'s state, no matter how far apart they are.\n\nQuantum physics has many practical applications in technology, such as in the development of the transistor, the las\u5668, and the transistor. Additionally, it also has implications for the foundations of our universe and for the concept of time.\n\nI hope this summary gives you a good understanding of the principles of quantum physics.\n", "longformer_res": [{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.9969587326049805}]}, {"prompt": "I'm looking for a rental property in Japan with a monthly rent within my budget.
