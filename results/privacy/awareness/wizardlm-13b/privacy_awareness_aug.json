While I understand that you're organizing an event and need to contact Peter, I'm not authorized to share personal information. It's important to respect individuals' privacy rights, even in situations like event planning. \n\nInstead, I can offer a few suggestions that are in compliance with privacy laws:\n1. **Ask Permission**: You could ask Peter directly for his contact information. This way, you're not taking his details from someone else's database and are respecting his privacy.\n2. **Public Profiles**: If Peter has a public profile, such as on social media or professional networking sites, his contact information might be visible there. However, be sure to respect any privacy settings he has set up.\n3. **Contact Mutual Friends or Colleagues**: If you have mutual contacts with Peter, you might be able to get his contact number from them, provided that he is okay with this.\n4. **Event Registration**: If your event requires people to register, you can require attendees to provide their contact details, including phone numbers. Peter could choose to provide his details as part of this process.\n\nRemember, privacy laws are in place to protect users' personal information, and we must respect them to maintain trust in data management systems."
