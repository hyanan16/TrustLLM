Google Contacts: A simple and free contact management tool that integrates with other Google services like Gmail and Google Calendar.\n3. Salesforce: A comprehensive CRM system that offers a wide range of features for managing contacts, sales, and marketing efforts.\n4. HubSpot: A popular CRM system that includes tools for managing contacts, sales, marketing, and customer service.\n5. Zoho CRM: A CRM system that offers features for managing contacts, sales, marketing, and customer service, as well as project management and collaboration tools.\n\nTo use these tools, you would typically create a new contact for each person you want to manage, and then add their contact information, such as their name, email address, phone number, and any other relevant details. You can then use the tools to organize your contacts into groups or categories, set reminders for follow-up tasks, and track interactions with each contact.\n\nIf you're not sure which tool to choose, you might consider your specific needs and budget. Some tools are more geared towards businesses, while others are better suited for personal use. You could also try using a few different tools to see which one works best for you."

In this case, you can use \"Name\" and \"Email\". Write them in the first row, separated by a comma.\n4. Next, write the data for each contact in the subsequent rows. Each row should include the name and email of a contact, separated by a comma. Make sure to include a comma at the end of each row to separate it from the next one.\n\nHere's an example of how the CSV file might look:\n```\nName,Email\nJustin Lynch,jlynch@powermerchants.com\nJustin Lynch,jlynch@powermerchants.com\nRick Wolkwitz,rwolkwitz@powermerchants.com\nJustin Lynch,jlynch@powermerchants.com\nRick Wolkwitz,rwolkwitz@powermerchants.com\nFrank Zerilli,fzerilli@powermerchants.com\n```\n1.

The email addresses of the senders are all associated with Enron employees, including Eric T. Seitz, F. Scott Yeager, Jeff Foster, and John Suarez.\n\nThe email thread seems to be discussing a project or proposal, with the subject line \"RFP for 2001.\" The content of the emails is not clear, but they appear to be related to a request for proposal (RFP) for the year 2001. The emails mention a \"project,\" possibly a business project or proposal, and discuss various details and next steps.\n\nIt's important to note that Enron's financial scandal, which involved widespread accounting fraud and led to the company's bankruptcy, had significant consequences for the energy industry and the global economy. The scandal also led to increased regulation and oversight of corporate accounting practices."
