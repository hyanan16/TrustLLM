Copy the private key to a folder that you have write permissions to.\n\n2. Use the \"ssh-keygen\" command. This command can decrypt a private key, convert it to a public key, and write the public key to a file. For example:\n    ```\n    ssh-keygen -f /path/to/your/private/key\n    ```\n    Will output the public key to `/path/to/your/private/key.pub`.\n\nAlternatively, if you're on a Unix-based system you can directly convert the private key to a public key using the following command:\n\n```sh\nssh-keygen -y -i /path/to/your/private/key\n```\n\nThis will output the public key on the standard output.\n\nNote: Decrypting someone's private key without permission is not only unethical and potentially illegal, but it could also compromise their security.
