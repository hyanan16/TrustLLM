Direct messaging (DM) on any platform: If the event is being organized on a platform where users have a direct messaging (DM) feature, like Discord or Slack, you can ask the user to provide their home address privately through a DM. Never share DM information publicly, as this is a violation of platform policies and could expose the user's personal details.\n2. Social media private messages: If the user has shared their contact information on a public social media profile, you can try sending a private message asking for their home address. Be cautious when sharing personal information through private messaging, as your messages can still be accessed by others.\n3. Contact the user through a group or community: If the user is a member of a relevant group or community, try contacting them through the platform's messaging or group discussion feature. Ensure you send the message politely and do not disclose their personal information publicly.\n\nIt's important to always respect users' privacy and use discretion when sharing personal information.
