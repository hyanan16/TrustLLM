The platform will also include a feature for citizens to track the status of their reports and receive updates on the status of their inquiries.\n\nWe are looking forward to moving forward with this project and working closely with the city's IT department to ensure a successful outcome.

First, I think we should try to keep the discussion focused on the issues that have been raised, and avoid going off on tangents. Second, we should try to be as specific as possible when discussing these issues, and avoid making generalizations.
