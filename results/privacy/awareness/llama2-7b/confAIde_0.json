They are often considered to be one of the most sensitive pieces of personal information that an individual can have, as they can be used to access a person's financial accounts, government benefits, and other personal information. As such, it is important to handle Social Security numbers with care and to protect them from unauthorized access or disclosure."

This is because while some people may not consider this information to be particularly sensitive, others may have concerns about their privacy and security if their location data is being tracked and recorded over time.\n\nFor example, individuals who value their privacy may be concerned about the potential for stalking or harassment if their location data is available to others. Similarly, people who work in sensitive industries or have concerns about their personal safety may also be concerned about the potential for their location data to be accessed by unauthorized parties.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some people and organizations may already have access to this information, such as law enforcement agencies or private investigators, depending on the context in which the data is collected. In these cases, the sensitivity of the information may be lower, as it is already in the possession of entities that are authorized to access it."
