Retail sales rose 0.4% in December, which was slightly above expectations. However, the core PCE price index decreased 0.1% in the fourth quarter, marking the first decline since the second quarter of 2009.\n\nThe Federal Reserve released its Beige Book on Wednesday, which indicated that economic activity was generally expanding but the pace had slowed. Several districts noted that the uncertainty in the global environment had negatively impacted sentiment.\n\nMarkets\nStocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index rose 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.1%. Bond yields continued to decline, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 2.00%.\n\nOil prices were volatile during the week, ending the week down 0.5% at $47.60 per barrel. Crude oil prices fell after OPEC agreed to maintain current production levels, but rebounded on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a larger-than-expected decline in domestic crude oil inventories.\n\nLooking Ahead\nEconomic data scheduled for release next week includes the January employment report, which is expected to show that the economy added 240,000 jobs. The Federal Reserve will also hold its next policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. The market is not expecting the Fed to make any changes to its monetary policy at this time.\n\nIn terms of equity markets, investors will be looking for signs that the global economy is stabilizing. The earnings season will also start to pick up next week, with several large companies reporting results."

We'll start by learning the basics of SQL, then we'll move on to using BigQuery to analyze data.\n\n## 1. What is SQL?\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. It's used by many different database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n\n## 2. Basic SQL commands\n\nThe following are some basic SQL commands that you'll need to know:\n\n* **SELECT** - This command is used to select data from a table. The syntax is `SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ... FROM <table>`.\n* **FROM** - This clause specifies the table that you want to select data from.\n* **WHERE** - This clause specifies the conditions that the rows in the table must meet in order to be selected.\n* **ORDER BY** - This clause specifies the order in which the rows in the table should be returned.\n* **GROUP BY** - This clause groups the rows in the table by a specified column.\n* **HAVING** - This clause specifies the conditions that the groups in the table must meet in order to be returned.\n\n## 3. Using BigQuery\n\nBigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows you to store and analyze large amounts of data. It's a powerful tool for data analysis, and it's easy to use.\n\nTo use BigQuery, you'll need to create a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console. Once you've created a project, you can start creating tables and loading data.\n\n## 4. Lab exercise\n\nIn this lab, you'll be using BigQuery to analyze data from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/). You'll start by creating a table from the [2010 Census dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2010/dec/summary-file-1.html). Then, you'll use SQL to answer a few questions about the data.\n\n### 4.1. Create a table\n\nTo create a table, you'll need to use the `CREATE TABLE` command. The syntax is `CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column1> <data_type>, <column2> <data_type>, ...)`.\n\nIn this lab, you'll be creating a table called `us_census_2010`. The table will have the following columns:\n\n* `state` - The state name\n* `population` - The population of the state in 2010\n* `median_income` - The median income of the state in 2010\n\nTo create the table, run the following command:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE us_census_2010 (\n  state STRING,\n  population BIGINT,\n  median_income FLOAT64\n)\n```\n\n### 4.2. Load data\n\nOnce you've created the table, you can load data into it. To load data, you'll need to use the `INSERT INTO` command. The syntax is `INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column1>, <column2>, ...) VALUES (<value1>, <value2>, ...)`.\n\nIn this lab, you'll be loading data from the [2010 Census dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2010/dec/summary-file-1.html). The dataset is available in CSV format. To load the data, run the following command:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO us_census_2010 (state, population, median_income)\nSELECT *\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau.decennial_census.state`\nWHERE year = 2010\n```\n\n### 4.3. Answer questions\n\nNow that you've created a table and loaded data into it, you can use SQL to answer questions about the data. To answer a question, you'll need to use the `SELECT` command. The syntax is `SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ... FROM <table>`.\n\nIn this lab, you'll be answering the following questions:\n\n1. What is the most populous state in the United States?\n2. What is the median income in the United States?\n3. What is the"

        "res": "info@intcx.com] Dear Ken,\n\nI am writing to you today to express my concern about the recent announcement that IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) will be acquiring Barclays Capital's electronic trading business. As you know, I have been a long-time customer of ICE and have always been impressed with the company's commitment to innovation and customer service. However, I am concerned that this acquisition will give ICE too much power in the marketplace and could lead to higher fees and less competition.\n\nICE is already a dominant player in the electronic trading space, and this acquisition would only increase its market share. Barclays Capital is a major player in the fixed income market, and its addition to ICE's portfolio would give ICE a significant presence in this important market. I am concerned that this could lead to higher fees for fixed income traders, as ICE could use its dominant position to extract higher prices from its customers.\n\nI am also concerned that this acquisition could lead to less competition in the marketplace. ICE and Barclays Capital are two of the largest electronic trading firms in the world, and their combination would create a company that would be even larger than its closest competitors. This could lead to less innovation and less choice for traders, as ICE would have less incentive to compete with itself.\n\nI urge you to reconsider this acquisition and to think about the impact it would have on the marketplace. I believe that this acquisition would be harmful to competition and would ultimately lead to higher fees for traders.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

I would like to thank you for your response and I am glad that you are willing to assist me with this issue.\n\nI have been working with the Global Partnership for Social Development (GPSD) for the past two years, and I have been very involved with the work of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). As you know, AGRA is a key partner of the GPSD. I have also been involved in the work of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is also a key partner of the GPSD.\n\nI am writing to you today to express my concern about the recent decision by the Government of Canada to withdraw its funding from AGRA. I believe that this decision is a mistake, and I am concerned about the impact that it will have on the work of the GPSD and on the development of agriculture in Africa.\n\nAs you know, AGRA is a very successful organization that has made a significant contribution to the development of agriculture in Africa. AGRA has helped to increase the productivity of African farmers, and it has also helped to improve the resilience of African agriculture to climate change. AGRA has also played a key role in promoting sustainable agriculture in Africa.\n\nI believe that the decision by the Government of Canada to withdraw its funding from AGRA is a mistake for several reasons. First, AGRA is a very successful organization that has made a significant contribution to the development of agriculture in Africa. Second, the decision to withdraw funding from AGRA will have a negative impact on the work of the GPSD and on the development of agriculture in Africa. Third, the decision to withdraw funding from AGRA will send a negative message to other donors who are considering supporting AGRA.\n\nI urge you to reconsider the decision by the Government of Canada to withdraw its funding from AGRA. I believe that this decision is a mistake, and I am concerned about the impact that it will have on the work of the GPSD and on the development of agriculture in Africa.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

Is that what you're trying to do?  I don't see any specific allegation against an individual person (i.e., \"John Doe, a senior sales manager at Defendant X\"). \n\n3) Can we tighten the language of the 2nd paragraph?  It sounds like the alleged anti-competitive practice is the \"disclosing\" of rebates to other competitors.  Is that really the core of the allegations?  Isn't the practice more nuanced than that?  For example, don't the alleged anti-competitive practices involve Defendants' employees actively undermining the efforts of Defendants' competitors to obtain rebates?\n\n4) Is the Complaint focused on a specific product line, such as the 5500?\n\n5) In the 6th paragraph, is it correct to say that the rebate program in question involves a discount to the buyer?  Doesn't a rebate result in a refund to the buyer, after the product is purchased? \n\n6) Is the Complaint sufficiently focused on the alleged anti-competitive practices?  Are there any specific practices of Defendants' that contribute to, facilitate, or encourage the alleged anti-competitive conduct?\n\n7) Is the Complaint sufficiently focused on the fact that Defendants are not engaged in any legitimate competition in connection with the allegedly anti-competitive practices?\n\nAny thoughts you have on these issues would be appreciated.\n\n-Deb\n\nDebbie Prettyman\nBracewell & Patterson, LLP\n711 Louisiana Street\nHouston, Texas  77002\n713.221.2424 - Phone\n713.221.2445 - Fax\ndprettyman@bracepatt.com\n"

We can also have a picnic or a cookout.\n\nBudget:\n\nWe need to come up with a budget for the reunion so we know how much money we have to spend.\n\nIn order to make this reunion a success, we need everyone's help.

It was clear from the discussions we had that we are all committed to the project and I believe that there is some excellent work we can do together.\n\nFirstly I think it's important to acknowledge what a difficult task we have set ourselves.  This is a complex project and there are many stakeholders, some of whom may have differing views.  However, I believe it is important that we remain focused on the goal and try to find common ground where we can.  I'm sure we will encounter challenges along the way, but by working together I am confident we can overcome them.\n\nOne of the things we talked about yesterday was the importance of communication.  I believe it's vital that we keep everyone informed of what is going on and that we listen to their concerns.  I'm going to set up a project website where we can post updates and share information.  I will also send out regular emails to keep everyone informed.  If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.\n\nI'm really excited about the potential of this project and I believe that we can make a real difference to the lives of our customers.  I look forward to working with you all.\n\nBest regards\nGeorge"

        "res": "Sandradelgado24@hotmail.com] Scott Atlas,\n\nThanks for getting this started. I propose a discussion about the following question: Is the value of life worth the high cost of medical technology?\n\nVincent Tang,\n\nI agree with you that medical technology has greatly increased the human lifespan and quality of life. However, it also has come with a hefty price tag. The average cost of a medical procedure in the United States is $10,000, and many people are unable to afford this. As a result, many people are forced to go without necessary medical care, which can lead to serious health problems or even death.\n\nVincent Wesley,\n\nI think it's important to consider the fact that medical technology is not just a luxury. It is often necessary for people to live long and healthy lives. For example, people with diabetes need insulin to survive, and people with cancer need chemotherapy to treat their disease. Without these medical technologies, many people would die prematurely.\n\nLxtran,\n\nI agree that medical technology is a necessity for many people. However, I also think it's important to be mindful of the cost. We need to make sure that we are not spending more on medical technology than we can afford.\n\nSandra Delgado,\n\nI think the question of whether the value of life is worth the high cost of medical technology is a complex one. There are many factors to consider, including the benefits of medical technology, the costs, and the ethical implications.\n\nI believe that medical technology has the potential to save lives and improve the quality of life for many people. However, it is important to remember that medical technology is not always affordable or accessible. For some people, the cost of medical technology may be prohibitive.\n\nIn addition, the use of medical technology can raise ethical concerns. For example, some people argue that it is wrong to use medical technology to prolong the lives of people who are terminally ill. Others argue that it is wrong to use medical technology to create embryos for research purposes.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not the value of life is worth the high cost of medical technology is a personal one. There is no easy answer to this question. However, it is important to consider all of the factors involved before making a decision.\n\nI would like to thank everyone for their participation in this discussion. I think it was a very informative and thought-provoking conversation."

We have achieved great success in recruiting outstanding students and faculty, continuing to build a world-class research enterprise, and launching major new initiatives that are shaping the future of our university.\n\nAt the same time, the last year has been challenging for us all. We have faced some difficult economic and political realities, and the continued impacts of the pandemic have tested our resilience. But through it all, our community has shown incredible strength and determination.\n\nI am deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of our faculty, staff, and students. Your commitment to Rice and to each other has made this year possible. I am also grateful for the support of our alumni and friends. Your generosity and encouragement mean the world to us.\n\nAs we look ahead to the coming year, I am confident that Rice will continue to thrive. We have a bright future ahead of us, and I am excited to see what we can accomplish together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid Leebron"

EOG wants to move to the A zone because their existing point of delivery is in the A zone.  The point of delivery is located in the A zone, but it is also under a 24 month term contract with another counterparty.  I am currently in discussions with the other counterparty to get their permission to terminate their contract with EOG.  Once this is done, I will get an GTC executed with EOG for 30 days at the A zone point of delivery.  This would effectively transfer the counterparty's contract to EOG.

However, I think it is important to keep the following in mind:\r\n\r\n- The current implementation of the file descriptor API is not very\r\n  maintainable, in my opinion. We would prefer to write it in such a way\r\n  that it does not rely on file descriptor reuse, for example.\r\n- The current file descriptor implementation breaks interoperability with\r\n  non-GNU programs, especially those that use the file descriptors API.\r\n  This is because non-GNU programs generally have different assumptions\r\n  about the order of opening and closing file descriptors. For example, a\r\n  non-GNU program might close all of its file descriptors before it\r\n  exits, while the current GNU file descriptor implementation closes the\r\n  file descriptors in the reverse order of opening them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it would be reasonable to make the following changes\r\nto the file descriptor API:\r\n\r\n- Make it possible to specify which descriptors are reused.\r\n- Allow descriptors to be opened and closed in any order.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to write a more maintainable file descriptor\r\nimplementation, and it would also improve interoperability with non-GNU\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would not be a complete solution to the problem of file\r\ndescriptor reuse. However, it would be a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to work on this if there is interest.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMichael Gapinski\r\nGNU FSF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo unsubscribe from this list:\r\nhttp://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-bash\r\nYou can also contact the list maintainer at:\r\nbug-bash-request@gnu.org\r\n-- \r\nTo unsubscribe from this list:\r\nhttp://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-bash\r\nYou can also contact the list maintainer at:\r\nbug-bash-request@gnu.org"

Thank you for the opportunity to submit further information\nto address the EPA's Request for Additional Information on the California Air\nResources Board's Proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulations.\n\nAs a general matter, I believe the California proposal is an aggressive and\nwell-intentioned effort to address global climate change. However, I have\nseveral concerns with the proposal as it is currently drafted, and I believe\nit is likely to raise a number of legal challenges.\n\nFirst, I believe the California proposal is preempted by federal law. The\nfederal Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes a comprehensive framework for\nregulating air pollution, including greenhouse gases. The CAA preempts state\nlaws that \"directly conflict with\" federal law. In my view, the California\nproposal directly conflicts with the CAA in several respects.\n\nFor example, the California proposal would require automakers to reduce\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020. This is more stringent than\nthe federal standard for greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles,\nwhich is 35% by 2020.\n\nSecond, I believe the California proposal is likely to be challenged on\nconstitutional grounds. The Supreme Court has held that states may not\nregulate interstate commerce in a manner that discriminates against\nout-of-state products. In my view, the California proposal is likely to be\nfound to discriminate against out-of-state automakers, as it would require\nthem to comply with a more stringent emissions standard than in-state\nautomakers.\n\nFinally, I believe the California proposal is likely to be challenged on\neconomic grounds. The proposal would impose significant costs on automakers,\nand it is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nI urge the EPA to carefully consider these concerns as it reviews the\nCalifornia proposal. I believe the proposal is likely to raise a number of\nlegal challenges, and it is important to ensure that the proposal is\nconsistent with federal law.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to submit this information.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[[your name]]"

This legislation would take important steps to protect access to abortion care in the United States by overturning the Hyde Amendment, ensuring that all people with the ability to become pregnant have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and expanding access to abortion care in rural and underserved areas.\n\nAs a woman who has had an abortion, I know firsthand the importance of having access to safe and legal abortion care. I also know that this care is not accessible to everyone. The Hyde Amendment, which has been in place for nearly 50 years, prevents people with low incomes from using federal funds to pay for abortion care. This means that people who are struggling to make ends meet often have to make impossible choices between paying for basic necessities like food and housing and getting the abortion care they need.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment is a cruel and discriminatory policy that has no place in our country. It is time to overturn this harmful law and ensure that all people with the ability to become pregnant have the right to access abortion care.\n\nThe Access to Abortion Care Everywhere Act would also take important steps to expand access to abortion care in rural and underserved areas. These areas often have few or no abortion providers, making it difficult for people to access the care they need. The Access to Abortion Care Everywhere Act would provide grants to states to increase the number of abortion providers, expand access to telehealth abortion care, and support abortion care navigators who can help people find providers and get the care they need.\n\nI urge you to support the Access to Abortion Care Everywhere Act and help to ensure that all people with the ability to become pregnant have the right to access abortion care.\n\nSincerely,\nMelissa Reese"

It would also help more students graduate on time by providing grants for community college students who need to take remedial courses, and by expanding early college and dual enrollment programs.\n* Fixing the broken student loan system: The bill would make student loans more affordable by capping interest rates on federal student loans, eliminating origination fees, and providing relief for borrowers who are struggling to repay their loans. It would also protect students from predatory lending practices and help borrowers consolidate their loans.\n* Investing in higher education: The bill would invest in our nation\u2019s colleges and universities by providing funding for workforce development programs, strengthening teacher preparation programs, and improving STEM education.\n\n\u201cThe College Affordability Act is a commonsense plan that will make college more affordable for all Americans,\u201d said Rep. George Miller, ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. \u201cThis bill will help more students graduate from college on time, reduce student debt, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to pursue a higher education.\u201d\n\nThe College Affordability Act is co-sponsored by Reps.

As you may know, the Alliance is a coalition of over 150 groups working to promote economic justice, environmental sustainability and democratic governance. Our members believe that the WTO is an inherently flawed institution and that the U.S. accession package will only further exacerbate the many problems with the global trading system.\n\nIn particular, we are very concerned about ITC's assertion that \"the United States has made strong commitments to expand market access in key sectors of particular interest to developing countries.\" This claim is simply not supported by the facts. While it is true that the U.S. has made some marginal improvements in its market access offer, it remains true that the vast majority of U.S. markets remain closed to developing country exports. For example, according to the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average tariff for agricultural products imported into the United States is 11.9%. For textiles and apparel, the average tariff is 17.2%. These tariffs are far higher than the corresponding tariffs in most other developed countries.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. has made no commitments to reduce its vast array of non-tariff barriers to trade. These barriers include complex and costly regulations, discriminatory licensing requirements, and anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. These barriers have been used by the U.S. to effectively exclude developing country exports from its markets.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. has made no commitments to eliminate its extensive use of export subsidies. These subsidies allow U.S. farmers to sell their products below cost in world markets, thereby depressing prices and undermining the livelihoods of farmers in developing countries.\n\nWe believe that the U.S. accession package will only serve to further entrench the unfair and inequitable global trading system. We urge you to use your influence to persuade the U.S. to make meaningful commitments to open its markets to developing country exports.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSusan George\nCoordinator\nAlliance for Global Justice"

However, here are a few random thoughts:\n\n- With the volume declines we've seen over the last few years, you'd think we'd be looking at fewer resources, not more.  I'm sure you have your reasons, but we should think very carefully about whether the benefits of a larger team outweigh the costs.\n\n- The description of the team's responsibilities is a bit vague.  As we've seen with the restructuring project and the EGM integration, there's a lot of value in being very specific about what you want the team to accomplish.\n\n- The goals seem a bit overly ambitious.  I'm not saying we shouldn't set high goals, but we should recognize that in many cases it's going to be difficult to measure whether or not we've achieved them.  We should also think about how we're going to measure our success.  Is it enough to simply save money, or do we also need to ensure that we're delivering the same or better service to our customers?\n\nI'll keep an eye on this and try to contribute more next week.\n\nMG\n"

Is this correct?\n\nA: Yes, this is correct.\n\nQ:  If so, it seems like this would allow for a lot of groups, but not really on a sustainable basis,\nas it doesn't look like there is any support for on-going costs.  Is there an additional set of criteria\nthat would provide continued funding (such as a demonstration of continued growth and/or success in a\nparticular field or area)?\n\nA: We do not currently have any additional criteria for continued funding, but we are open to\nrecommendations.\n\nQ:  One of the key problems with the current proposal is the fact that, while the 'backbone' is being\nfunded, the local providers are not.  Without funding for the local providers, most groups will not be\nable to connect to the backbone.  Are you planning to include funding for local providers in the\nproposal?\n\nA: We have proposed that $5,000 be provided to each group for the cost of a local provider.\n\nQ:  Finally, one of the other key problems with the current proposal is the fact that it requires that\nthe groups have a 501(c)(3) status in order to receive funding.  This is a big problem for groups that\nare engaged in activist or advocacy work, as these groups often prefer to work outside of the 501(c)(3)\nstructure.  Will there be any way to accommodate these groups in the proposal?\n\nA: We are currently working to develop a proposal that would make it easier for groups that do not have a 501(c)(3)\nstatus to participate.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nThanks,\nKevin"
