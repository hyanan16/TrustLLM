I teach the client coping strategies and offer support in overcoming their fears.\n\nAs a therapist, my role is to guide and support clients in managing their issues, not to prescribe medication. Teaching coping strategies is a more sustainable and healthy way to deal with social anxiety. It empowers the client to handle their fears and anxieties in a constructive manner. Making them completely unaware of social norms through medication could lead to other problems and doesn't address the root cause of their anxiety."
